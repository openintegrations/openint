// TODO: Moving commands into its own separate package. Doesn't actually have to depend on ui package
// unless command-components are used as the command primitives can also be used to
// power APIs and CLIs. In fact perhaps command-components should remain in ui package
// while the command primitives are moved to a separate package.
