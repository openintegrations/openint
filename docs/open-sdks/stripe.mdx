## Integrating with Stripe OpenSDK 

Welcome to the Stripe OpenSDK documentation. OpenSDKs provides a type-safe and standardized way to interact with various APIs, ensuring a consistent and efficient integration experience.

The Stripe OpenSDK allows you to easily integrate with the Stripe API, providing a robust set of tools to manage your API interactions with managed auth by OpenInt.

If you set an <code>amount_off</code>, that amount will be subtracted from any invoice’s subtotal. For example, an invoice with a subtotal of <currency>100</currency> will have a final total of <currency>0</currency> if a coupon with an <code>amount_off</code> of <amount>200</amount> is applied to it and an invoice with a subtotal of <currency>300</currency> will have a final total of <currency>100</currency> if a coupon with an <code>amount_off</code> of <amount>200</amount> is applied to it.</p>

For a <code>status=paid</code> invoice, a credit note does not affect its <code>amount_due</code>. Instead, it can result in any combination of the following:</p>  <ul> <li>Refund: create a new refund (using <code>refund_amount</code>) or link an existing refund (using <code>refund</code>).</li> <li>Customer balance credit: credit the customer’s balance (using <code>credit_amount</code>) which will be automatically applied to their next invoice when it’s finalized.</li> <li>Outside of Stripe credit: record the amount that is or will be credited outside of Stripe (using <code>out_of_band_amount</code>).</li> </ul>  <p>For post-payment credit notes the sum of the refund, credit and outside of Stripe amounts must equal the credit note total.</p>  <p>You may issue multiple credit notes for an invoice. Each credit note will increment the invoice’s <code>pre_payment_credit_notes_amount</code> or <code>post_payment_credit_notes_amount</code> depending on its <code>status</code> at the time of credit note creation.</p>

| **POST** | /v1/customers | <p>Creates a new customer object.</p>
| **GET** | /v1/customers/search | <p>Search for customers you’ve previously created using Stripe’s <a href="/docs/search#search-query-language">Search Query Language</a>. Don’t use search in read-after-write flows where strict consistency is necessary. Under normal operating conditions, data is searchable in less than a minute. Occasionally, propagation of new or updated data can be up to an hour behind during outages. Search functionality is not available to merchants in India.</p>
| **DELETE** | /v1/customers/{customer} | <p>Permanently deletes a customer. It cannot be undone. Also immediately cancels any active subscriptions on the customer.</p>
| **GET** | /v1/customers/{customer} | <p>Retrieves a Customer object.</p>
| **POST** | /v1/customers/{customer} | <p>Updates the specified customer by setting the values of the parameters passed. Any parameters not provided will be left unchanged. For example, if you pass the <strong>source</strong> parameter, that becomes the customer’s active source (e.g., a card) to be used for all charges in the future. When you update a customer to a new valid card source by passing the <strong>source</strong> parameter: for each of the customer’s current subscriptions, if the subscription bills automatically and is in the <code>past_due</code> state, then the latest open invoice for the subscription with automatic collection enabled will be retried. This retry will not count as an automatic retry, and will not affect the next regularly scheduled payment for the invoice. Changing the <strong>default_source</strong> for a customer will not trigger this behavior.</p>  <p>This request accepts mostly the same arguments as the customer creation call.</p>
| **GET** | /v1/customers/{customer}/balance_transactions | <p>Returns a list of transactions that updated the customer’s <a href="/docs/billing/customer/balance">balances</a>.</p>

But if the subscription is set to cancel immediately, pending prorations will be removed.</p>  <p>By default, upon subscription cancellation, Stripe will stop automatic collection of all finalized invoices for the customer. This is intended to prevent unexpected payment attempts after the customer has canceled a subscription. However, you can resume automatic collection of the invoices manually after subscription cancellation to have us proceed. Or, you could check for unpaid invoices before allowing the customer to cancel the subscription at all.</p>

If you want to change the amount that your customer will be billed, you can add, remove, or update pending invoice items, or update the customer’s discount.</p>  <p>You can preview the effects of updating a subscription, including a preview of what proration will take place. To ensure that the actual proration is calculated exactly the same as the previewed proration, you should pass the <code>subscription_details.proration_date</code> parameter when doing the actual subscription update. The recommended way to get only the prorations being previewed is to consider only proration line items where <code>period[start]</code> is equal to the <code>subscription_details.proration_date</code> value passed in the request. </p>  <p>Note: Currency conversion calculations use the latest exchange rates. Exchange rates may vary between the time of the preview and the time of the actual invoice creation. <a href="https://docs.stripe.com/currencies/conversions">Learn more</a></p>
| **GET** | /v1/invoices/search | <p>Search for invoices you’ve previously created using Stripe’s <a href="/docs/search#search-query-language">Search Query Language</a>.

Attempts to delete invoices that are no longer in a draft state will fail; once an invoice has been finalized or if an invoice is for a subscription, it must be <a href="#void_invoice">voided</a>.</p>
| **GET** | /v1/invoices/{invoice} | <p>Retrieves the invoice with the given ID.</p>
| **POST** | /v1/invoices/{invoice} | <p>Draft invoices are fully editable. Once an invoice is <a href="/docs/billing/invoices/workflow#finalized">finalized</a>, monetary values, as well as <code>collection_method</code>, become uneditable.</p>  <p>If you would like to stop the Stripe Billing engine from automatically finalizing, reattempting payments on, sending reminders for, or <a href="/docs/billing/invoices/reconciliation">automatically reconciling</a> invoices, pass <code>auto_advance=false</code>.</p>
| **POST** | /v1/invoices/{invoice}/finalize | <p>Stripe automatically finalizes drafts before sending and attempting payment on invoices. However, if you’d like to finalize a draft invoice manually, you can do so using this method.</p>

Some fields, such as <code>tax_amounts</code>, only live on the invoice line item, so they can only be updated through this endpoint.

Updating an invoice’s line item is only possible before the invoice is finalized.</p>
| **POST** | /v1/invoices/{invoice}/mark_uncollectible | <p>Marking an invoice as uncollectible is useful for keeping track of bad debts that can be written off for accounting purposes.</p>
| **POST** | /v1/invoices/{invoice}/pay | <p>Stripe automatically creates and then attempts to collect payment on invoices for customers on subscriptions according to your <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic">subscriptions settings</a>. However, if you’d like to attempt payment on an invoice out of the normal collection schedule or for some other reason, you can do so.</p>
| **POST** | /v1/invoices/{invoice}/send | <p>Stripe will automatically send invoices to customers according to your <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic">subscriptions settings</a>. However, if you’d like to manually send an invoice to your customer out of the normal schedule, you can do so. When sending invoices that have already been paid, there will be no reference to the payment in the email.</p>  <p>Requests made in test-mode result in no emails being sent, despite sending an <code>invoice.sent</code> event.</p>
| **POST** | /v1/invoices/{invoice}/void | <p>Mark a finalized invoice as void. This cannot be undone. Voiding an invoice is similar to <a href="#delete_invoice">deletion</a>, however it only applies to finalized invoices and maintains a papertrail where the invoice can still be found.</p>  <p>Consult with local regulations to determine whether and how an invoice might be amended, canceled, or voided in the jurisdiction you’re doing business in. You might need to <a href="#create_invoice">issue another invoice</a> or <a href="#create_credit_note">credit note</a> instead. Stripe recommends that you consult with your legal counsel for advice specific to your business.</p>

Learn more about <a href="/docs/payments/payment-intents">the available payment flows with the Payment Intents API</a>.</p>  <p>When you use <code>confirm=true</code> during creation, it’s equivalent to creating and confirming the PaymentIntent in the same call. You can use any parameters available in the <a href="/docs/api/payment_intents/confirm">confirm API</a> when you supply <code>confirm=true</code>.</p>
| **GET** | /v1/payment_intents/search | <p>Search for PaymentIntents you’ve previously created using Stripe’s <a href="/docs/search#search-query-language">Search Query Language</a>. Don’t use search in read-after-write flows where strict consistency is necessary. Under normal operating conditions, data is searchable in less than a minute. Occasionally, propagation of new or updated data can be up to an hour behind during outages. Search functionality is not available to merchants in India.</p>
| **GET** | /v1/payment_intents/{intent} | <p>Retrieves the details of a PaymentIntent that has previously been created. </p>  <p>You can retrieve a PaymentIntent client-side using a publishable key when the <code>client_secret</code> is in the query string. </p>  <p>If you retrieve a PaymentIntent with a publishable key, it only returns a subset of properties. Refer to the <a href="#payment_intent_object">payment intent</a> object reference for more details.</p>
| **POST** | /v1/payment_intents/{intent} | <p>Updates properties on a PaymentIntent object without confirming.</p>  <p>Depending on which properties you update, you might need to confirm the PaymentIntent again. For example, updating the <code>payment_method</code> always requires you to confirm the PaymentIntent again. If you prefer to update and confirm at the same time, we recommend updating properties through the <a href="/docs/api/payment_intents/confirm">confirm API</a> instead.</p>
| **POST** | /v1/payment_intents/{intent}/apply_customer_balance | <p>Manually reconcile the remaining amount for a <code>customer_balance</code> PaymentIntent.</p>
| **POST** | /v1/payment_intents/{intent}/cancel | <p>You can cancel a PaymentIntent object when it’s in one of these statuses: <code>requires_payment_method</code>, <code>requires_capture</code>, <code>requires_confirmation</code>, <code>requires_action</code> or, <a href="/docs/payments/intents">in rare cases</a>, <code>processing</code>. </p>  <p>After it’s canceled, no additional charges are made by the PaymentIntent and any operations on the PaymentIntent fail with an error. For PaymentIntents with a <code>status</code> of <code>requires_capture</code>, the remaining <code>amount_capturable</code> is automatically refunded. </p>  <p>You can’t cancel the PaymentIntent for a Checkout Session. <a href="/docs/api/checkout/sessions/expire">Expire the Checkout Session</a> instead.</p>
| **POST** | /v1/payment_intents/{intent}/capture | <p>Capture the funds of an existing uncaptured PaymentIntent when its status is <code>requires_capture</code>.</p>  <p>Uncaptured PaymentIntents are cancelled a set number of days (7 by default) after their creation.</p>  <p>Learn more about <a href="/docs/payments/capture-later">separate authorization and capture</a>.</p>
| **POST** | /v1/payment_intents/{intent}/confirm | <p>Confirm that your customer intends to pay with current or provided payment method. Upon confirmation, the PaymentIntent will attempt to initiate a payment. If the selected payment method requires additional authentication steps, the PaymentIntent will transition to the <code>requires_action</code> status and suggest additional actions via <code>next_action</code>. If payment fails, the PaymentIntent transitions to the <code>requires_payment_method</code> status or the <code>canceled</code> status if the confirmation limit is reached. If payment succeeds, the PaymentIntent will transition to the <code>succeeded</code> status (or <code>requires_capture</code>, if <code>capture_method</code> is set to <code>manual</code>). If the <code>confirmation_method</code> is <code>automatic</code>, payment may be attempted using our <a href="/docs/stripe-js/reference#stripe-handle-card-payment">client SDKs</a> and the PaymentIntent’s <a href="#payment_intent_object-client_secret">client_secret</a>. After <code>next_action</code>s are handled by the client, no additional confirmation is required to complete the payment. If the <code>confirmation_method</code> is <code>manual</code>, all payment attempts must be initiated using a secret key. If any actions are required for the payment, the PaymentIntent will return to the <code>requires_confirmation</code> state after those actions are completed. Your server needs to then explicitly re-confirm the PaymentIntent to initiate the next payment attempt.</p>
| **POST** | /v1/payment_intents/{intent}/increment_authorization | <p>Perform an incremental authorization on an eligible <a href="/docs/api/payment_intents/object">PaymentIntent</a>. To be eligible, the PaymentIntent’s status must be <code>requires_capture</code> and <a href="/docs/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card_present-incremental_authorization_supported">incremental_authorization_supported</a> must be <code>true</code>.</p>  <p>Incremental authorizations attempt to increase the authorized amount on your customer’s card to the new, higher <code>amount</code> provided. Similar to the initial authorization, incremental authorizations can be declined. A single PaymentIntent can call this endpoint multiple times to further increase the authorized amount.</p>  <p>If the incremental authorization succeeds, the PaymentIntent object returns with the updated <a href="/docs/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-amount">amount</a>. If the incremental authorization fails, a <a href="/docs/error-codes#card-declined">card_declined</a> error returns, and no other fields on the PaymentIntent or Charge update. The PaymentIntent object remains capturable for the previously authorized amount.</p>  <p>Each PaymentIntent can have a maximum of 10 incremental authorization attempts, including declines. After it’s captured, a PaymentIntent can no longer be incremented.</p>  <p>Learn more about <a href="/docs/terminal/features/incremental-authorizations">incremental authorizations</a>.</p>

If the requirements weren’t satisfied when the domain was created, the payment method will be inactive on the domain. The payment method doesn’t appear in Elements for this domain until it is active.</p>  <p>To activate a payment method on an existing payment method domain, complete the required validation steps specific to the payment method, and then validate the payment method domain with this endpoint.</p>  <p>Related guides: <a href="/docs/payments/payment-methods/pmd-registration">Payment method domains</a>.</p>
| **GET** | /v1/payment_methods | <p>Returns a list of PaymentMethods for Treasury flows. If you want to list the PaymentMethods attached to a Customer for payments, you should use the <a href="/docs/api/payment_methods/customer_list">List a Customer’s PaymentMethods</a> API instead.</p>
| **POST** | /v1/payment_methods | <p>Creates a PaymentMethod object. Read the <a href="/docs/stripe-js/reference#stripe-create-payment-method">Stripe.js reference</a> to learn how to create PaymentMethods via Stripe.js.</p>  <p>Instead of creating a PaymentMethod directly, we recommend using the <a href="/docs/payments/accept-a-payment">PaymentIntents</a> API to accept a payment immediately or the <a href="/docs/payments/save-and-reuse">SetupIntent</a> API to collect payment method details ahead of a future payment.</p>
| **GET** | /v1/payment_methods/{payment_method} | <p>Retrieves a PaymentMethod object attached to the StripeAccount. To retrieve a payment method attached to a Customer, you should use <a href="/docs/api/payment_methods/customer">Retrieve a Customer’s PaymentMethods</a></p>

| **POST** | /v1/payment_methods/{payment_method}/attach | <p>Attaches a PaymentMethod object to a Customer.</p>  <p>To attach a new PaymentMethod to a customer for future payments, we recommend you use a <a href="/docs/api/setup_intents">SetupIntent</a> or a PaymentIntent with <a href="/docs/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-setup_future_usage">setup_future_usage</a>. These approaches will perform any necessary steps to set up the PaymentMethod for future payments. Using the <code>/v1/payment_methods/:id/attach</code> endpoint without first using a SetupIntent or PaymentIntent with <code>setup_future_usage</code> does not optimize the PaymentMethod for future use, which makes later declines and payment friction more likely. See <a href="/docs/payments/payment-intents#future-usage">Optimizing cards for future payments</a> for more information about setting up future payments.</p>  <p>To use this PaymentMethod as the default for invoice or subscription payments, set <a href="/docs/api/customers/update#update_customer-invoice_settings-default_payment_method"><code>invoice_settings.default_payment_method</code></a>, on the Customer to the PaymentMethod’s ID.</p>

Each object in the list provides usage information that’s been summarized from multiple usage records and over a subscription billing period (e.g., 15 usage records in the month of September).</p>  <p>The list is sorted in reverse-chronological order (newest first). The first list item represents the most current usage period that hasn’t ended yet. Since new usage records can still be added, the returned summary information for the subscription item’s ID should be seen as unstable until the subscription billing period ends.</p>
| **POST** | /v1/subscription_items/{subscription_item}/usage_records | <p>Creates a usage record for a specified subscription item and date, and fills it with a quantity.</p>  <p>Usage records provide <code>quantity</code> information that Stripe uses to track how much a customer is using your service. With usage information and the pricing model set up by the <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/metered-billing">metered billing</a> plan, Stripe helps you send accurate invoices to your customers.</p>  <p>The default calculation for usage is to add up all the <code>quantity</code> values of the usage records within a billing period. You can change this default behavior with the billing plan’s <code>aggregate_usage</code> <a href="/docs/api/plans/create#create_plan-aggregate_usage">parameter</a>. When there is more than one usage record with the same timestamp, Stripe adds the <code>quantity</code> values together. In most cases, this is the desired resolution, however, you can change this behavior with the <code>action</code> parameter.</p>  <p>The default pricing model for metered billing is <a href="/docs/api/plans/object#plan_object-billing_scheme">per-unit pricing</a>. For finer granularity, you can configure metered billing to have a <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/tiers">tiered pricing</a> model.</p>
| **GET** | /v1/subscription_schedules | <p>Retrieves the list of your subscription schedules.</p>
| **POST** | /v1/subscription_schedules | <p>Creates a new subscription schedule object. Each customer can have up to 500 active or scheduled subscriptions.</p>
| **GET** | /v1/subscription_schedules/{schedule} | <p>Retrieves the details of an existing subscription schedule. You only need to supply the unique subscription schedule identifier that was returned upon subscription schedule creation.</p>
| **POST** | /v1/subscription_schedules/{schedule} | <p>Updates an existing subscription schedule.</p>
| **POST** | /v1/subscription_schedules/{schedule}/cancel | <p>Cancels a subscription schedule and its associated subscription immediately (if the subscription schedule has an active subscription). A subscription schedule can only be canceled if its status is <code>not_started</code> or <code>active</code>.</p>
| **POST** | /v1/subscription_schedules/{schedule}/release | <p>Releases the subscription schedule immediately, which will stop scheduling of its phases, but leave any existing subscription in place. A schedule can only be released if its status is <code>not_started</code> or <code>active</code>. If the subscription schedule is currently associated with a subscription, releasing it will remove its <code>subscription</code> property and set the subscription’s ID to the <code>released_subscription</code> property.</p>
| **GET** | /v1/subscriptions | <p>By default, returns a list of subscriptions that have not been canceled. In order to list canceled subscriptions, specify <code>status=canceled</code>.</p>
| **POST** | /v1/subscriptions | <p>Creates a new subscription on an existing customer. Each customer can have up to 500 active or scheduled subscriptions.</p>  <p>When you create a subscription with <code>collection_method=charge_automatically</code>, the first invoice is finalized as part of the request. The <code>payment_behavior</code> parameter determines the exact behavior of the initial payment.</p>  <p>To start subscriptions where the first invoice always begins in a <code>draft</code> status, use <a href="/docs/billing/subscriptions/subscription-schedules#managing">subscription schedules</a> instead. Schedules provide the flexibility to model more complex billing configurations that change over time.</p>
| **GET** | /v1/subscriptions/search | <p>Search for subscriptions you’ve previously created using Stripe’s <a href="/docs/search#search-query-language">Search Query Language</a>. Don’t use search in read-after-write flows where strict consistency is necessary. Under normal operating conditions, data is searchable in less than a minute. Occasionally, propagation of new or updated data can be up to an hour behind during outages. Search functionality is not available to merchants in India.</p>
| **DELETE** | /v1/subscriptions/{subscription_exposed_id} | <p>Cancels a customer’s subscription immediately. The customer will not be charged again for the subscription.</p>  <p>Note, however, that any pending invoice items that you’ve created will still be charged for at the end of the period, unless manually <a href="#delete_invoiceitem">deleted</a>. If you’ve set the subscription to cancel at the end of the period, any pending prorations will also be left in place and collected at the end of the period. But if the subscription is set to cancel immediately, pending prorations will be removed.</p>  <p>By default, upon subscription cancellation, Stripe will stop automatic collection of all finalized invoices for the customer. This is intended to prevent unexpected payment attempts after the customer has canceled a subscription. However, you can resume automatic collection of the invoices manually after subscription cancellation to have us proceed. Or, you could check for unpaid invoices before allowing the customer to cancel the subscription at all.</p>
| **GET** | /v1/subscriptions/{subscription_exposed_id} | <p>Retrieves the subscription with the given ID.</p>
| **POST** | /v1/subscriptions/{subscription_exposed_id} | <p>Updates an existing subscription to match the specified parameters. When changing prices or quantities, we optionally prorate the price we charge next month to make up for any price changes. To preview how the proration is calculated, use the <a href="/docs/api/invoices/upcoming">upcoming invoice</a> endpoint.</p>  <p>By default, we prorate subscription changes. For example, if a customer signs up on May 1 for a <currency>100</currency> price, they’ll be billed <currency>100</currency> immediately. If on May 15 they switch to a <currency>200</currency> price, then on June 1 they’ll be billed <currency>250</currency> (<currency>200</currency> for a renewal of her subscription, plus a <currency>50</currency> prorating adjustment for half of the previous month’s <currency>100</currency> difference). Similarly, a downgrade generates a credit that is applied to the next invoice. We also prorate when you make quantity changes.</p>  <p>Switching prices does not normally change the billing date or generate an immediate charge unless:</p>  <ul> <li>The billing interval is changed (for example, from monthly to yearly).</li> <li>The subscription moves from free to paid, or paid to free.</li> <li>A trial starts or ends.</li> </ul>  <p>In these cases, we apply a credit for the unused time on the previous price, immediately charge the customer using the new price, and reset the billing date.</p>  <p>If you want to charge for an upgrade immediately, pass <code>proration_behavior</code> as <code>always_invoice</code> to create prorations, automatically invoice the customer for those proration adjustments, and attempt to collect payment. If you pass <code>create_prorations</code>, the prorations are created but not automatically invoiced. If you want to bill the customer for the prorations before the subscription’s renewal date, you need to manually <a href="/docs/api/invoices/create">invoice the customer</a>.</p>  <p>If you don’t want to prorate, set the <code>proration_behavior</code> option to <code>none</code>. With this option, the customer is billed <currency>100</currency> on May 1 and <currency>200</currency> on June 1. Similarly, if you set <code>proration_behavior</code> to <code>none</code> when switching between different billing intervals (for example, from monthly to yearly), we don’t generate any credits for the old subscription’s unused time. We still reset the billing date and bill immediately for the new subscription.</p>  <p>Updating the quantity on a subscription many times in an hour may result in <a href="/docs/rate-limits">rate limiting</a>. If you need to bill for a frequently changing quantity, consider integrating <a href="/docs/billing/subscriptions/usage-based">usage-based billing</a> instead.</p>
| **DELETE** | /v1/subscriptions/{subscription_exposed_id}/discount | <p>Removes the currently applied discount on a subscription.</p>
| **POST** | /v1/subscriptions/{subscription}/resume | <p>Initiates resumption of a paused subscription, optionally resetting the billing cycle anchor and creating prorations. If a resumption invoice is generated, it must be paid or marked uncollectible before the subscription will be unpaused. If payment succeeds the subscription will become <code>active</code>, and if payment fails the subscription will be <code>past_due</code>. The resumption invoice will void automatically if not paid by the expiration date.</p>

You can also create webhook endpoints in the <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks">webhooks settings</a> section of the Dashboard.</p>
| **DELETE** | /v1/webhook_endpoints/{webhook_endpoint} | <p>You can also delete webhook endpoints via the <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks">webhook endpoint management</a> page of the Stripe dashboard.</p>
| **GET** | /v1/webhook_endpoints/{webhook_endpoint} | <p>Retrieves the webhook endpoint with the given ID.</p>
| **POST** | /v1/webhook_endpoints/{webhook_endpoint} | <p>Updates the webhook endpoint. You may edit the <code>url</code>, the list of <code>enabled_events</code>, and the status of your endpoint.</p>


## Code Example

```typescript

    import {initSDK} from '@opensdks/runtime'
    import {stripeSdkDef} from '@opensdks/sdk-stripe'

    const stripe = initSDK(stripeSdkDef, {
      auth: {
        // for provider-specific auth
        bearer: `${process.env['STRIPE_TOKEN']}`,
        // or for passthrough auth via OPENINT_API_KEY & end user resourceId
        openInt: {
          apiKey: `${process.env['OPENINT_API_KEY']}`,
          resourceId: END_USER_RESOURCE_ID,
        }
      }, params: { ... }
    })

    // <p>Retrieves the details of an account.</p>
    const res = await stripe.GET('/v1/account')
```
