## Integrating with Brex OpenSDK 

Welcome to the Brex OpenSDK documentation. OpenSDKs provides a type-safe and standardized way to interact with various APIs, ensuring a consistent and efficient integration experience.

The Brex OpenSDK allows you to easily integrate with the Brex API, providing a robust set of tools to manage your API interactions with managed auth by OpenInt. 

### Available Methods:

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **GET** | /v1/expenses/card | List expenses
| **POST** | /v1/expenses/card/receipt_match | Create a new receipt match
| **GET** | /v1/expenses/card/{expense_id} | Get an expense
| **PUT** | /v1/expenses/card/{expense_id} | Update an expense
| **POST** | /v1/expenses/card/{expense_id}/receipt_upload | Create a new receipt upload


## Code Example

```typescript

    import {initSDK} from '@opensdks/runtime'
    import {brexSdkDef} from '@opensdks/sdk-brex'

    const brex = initSDK(brexSdkDef, {
      auth: {
        // for provider-specific auth
        bearer: `${process.env['BREX_TOKEN']}`,
        // or for passthrough auth via OPENINT_API_KEY & end user resourceId
        openInt: {
          apiKey: `${process.env['OPENINT_API_KEY']}`,
          resourceId: END_USER_RESOURCE_ID,
        }
      }, params: { ... }
    })

    // List expenses
    const res = await brex.GET('/v1/expenses/card')
```
