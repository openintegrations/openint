## Integrating with Merge OpenSDK 

Welcome to the Merge OpenSDK documentation. OpenSDKs provides a type-safe and standardized way to interact with various APIs, ensuring a consistent and efficient integration experience.

The Merge OpenSDK allows you to easily integrate with the Merge API, providing a robust set of tools to manage your API interactions with managed auth by OpenInt.
