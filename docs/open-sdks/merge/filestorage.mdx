## Integrating with Merge OpenSDK 

Welcome to the Merge OpenSDK documentation. OpenSDKs provides a type-safe and standardized way to interact with various APIs, ensuring a consistent and efficient integration experience.

The Merge OpenSDK allows you to easily integrate with the Merge API, providing a robust set of tools to manage your API interactions with managed auth by OpenInt. 

### Available Methods:

| **GET** | /account-details | Get details for a linked account.
| **GET** | /account-token/{public_token} | Returns the account token for the end user with the provided public token.
| **POST** | /async-passthrough | Asynchronously pull data from an endpoint not currently supported by Merge.
| **GET** | /async-passthrough/{async_passthrough_receipt_id} | Retrieves data from earlier async-passthrough POST request
| **GET** | /audit-trail | Gets a list of audit trail events.
| **GET** | /available-actions | Returns a list of models and actions available for an account.
| **GET** | /default-scopes | Get the default permissions for Merge Common Models and fields across all Linked Accounts of a given category. [Learn more](https://help.merge.dev/en/articles/8828211-common-model-and-field-scopes).
| **POST** | /delete-account | Delete a linked account.
| **GET** | /drives | Returns a list of `Drive` objects.

| **PATCH** | /field-mappings/{field_mapping_id} | Create or update existing Field Mappings for a Linked Account. Changes will be reflected after the next scheduled sync. This will cause the next sync for this Linked Account to sync **ALL** data from start.
| **DELETE** | /field-mappings/{field_mapping_id} | Deletes Field Mappings for a Linked Account. All data related to this Field Mapping will be deleted and these changes will be reflected after the next scheduled sync. This will cause the next sync for this Linked Account to sync **ALL** data from start.
| **GET** | /files | Returns a list of `File` objects.
| **POST** | /files | Creates a `File` object with the given values.
| **GET** | /files/{id} | Returns a `File` object with the given `id`.

        // for provider-specific auth
        bearer: `${process.env['MERGE_TOKEN']}`,
        // or for passthrough auth via OPENINT_API_KEY & end user resourceId
        openInt: {

    })
