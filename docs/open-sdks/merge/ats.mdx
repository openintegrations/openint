## Integrating with Merge OpenSDK 

Welcome to the Merge OpenSDK documentation. OpenSDKs provides a type-safe and standardized way to interact with various APIs, ensuring a consistent and efficient integration experience.

The Merge OpenSDK allows you to easily integrate with the Merge API, providing a robust set of tools to manage your API interactions with managed auth by OpenInt.

      auth: {
        // for provider-specific auth
        bearer: `${process.env['MERGE_TOKEN']}`,
        // or for passthrough auth via OPENINT_API_KEY & end user resourceId
