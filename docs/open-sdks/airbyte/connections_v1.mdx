## Integrating with Airbyte OpenSDK 

Welcome to the Airbyte OpenSDK documentation. OpenSDKs provides a type-safe and standardized way to interact with various APIs, ensuring a consistent and efficient integration experience.

The Airbyte OpenSDK allows you to easily integrate with the Airbyte API, providing a robust set of tools to manage your API interactions with managed auth by OpenInt. 

### Available Methods:

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **POST** | /connections | Create a connection
| **GET** | /connections | List connections
| **GET** | /connections/{connectionId} | Get Connection details
| **PATCH** | /connections/{connectionId} | Update Connection details
| **DELETE** | /connections/{connectionId} | Delete a Connection
| **PARAMETERS** | /connections/{connectionId} | 


## Code Example

```typescript

    import {initSDK} from '@opensdks/runtime'
    import {airbyteSdkDef} from '@opensdks/sdk-airbyte'

    const airbyte = initSDK(airbyteSdkDef, {
      auth: {
        // for provider-specific auth
        bearer: `${process.env['AIRBYTE_TOKEN']}`,
        // or for passthrough auth via OPENINT_API_KEY & end user resourceId
        openInt: {
          apiKey: `${process.env['OPENINT_API_KEY']}`,
          resourceId: END_USER_RESOURCE_ID,
        }
      }
    })

    // Create a connection
    const res = await airbyte.POST('/connections')
```
