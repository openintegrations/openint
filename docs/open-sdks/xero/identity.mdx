## Integrating with Xero OpenSDK 

Welcome to the Xero OpenSDK documentation. OpenSDKs provides a type-safe and standardized way to interact with various APIs, ensuring a consistent and efficient integration experience.

The Xero OpenSDK allows you to easily integrate with the Xero API, providing a robust set of tools to manage your API interactions with managed auth by OpenInt. 

### Available Methods:

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **GET** | /Connections | Retrieves the connections for this user
| **DELETE** | /Connections/{id} | Deletes a connection for this user (i.e. disconnect a tenant)


## Code Example

```typescript

    import {initSDK} from '@opensdks/runtime'
    import {xeroSdkDef} from '@opensdks/sdk-xero'

    const xero = initSDK(xeroSdkDef, {
      auth: {
        // for provider-specific auth
        bearer: `${process.env['XERO_TOKEN']}`,
        // or for passthrough auth via OPENINT_API_KEY & end user resourceId
        openInt: {
          apiKey: `${process.env['OPENINT_API_KEY']}`,
          resourceId: END_USER_RESOURCE_ID,
        }
      }, params: { ... }
    })

    // Retrieves the connections for this user
    const res = await xero.GET('/Connections')
```
