## Integrating with Chargepoint OpenSDK 

Welcome to the Chargepoint OpenSDK documentation. OpenSDKs provides a type-safe and standardized way to interact with various APIs, ensuring a consistent and efficient integration experience.

The Chargepoint OpenSDK allows you to easily integrate with the Chargepoint API, providing a robust set of tools to manage your API interactions with managed auth by OpenInt. 

### Available Methods:

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **POST** | /user/login | 


## Code Example

```typescript

    import {initSDK} from '@opensdks/runtime'
    import {chargepointSdkDef} from '@opensdks/sdk-chargepoint'

    const chargepoint = initSDK(chargepointSdkDef, {
      auth: {
        // for provider-specific auth
        bearer: `${process.env['CHARGEPOINT_TOKEN']}`,
        // or for passthrough auth via OPENINT_API_KEY & end user resourceId
        openInt: {
          apiKey: `${process.env['OPENINT_API_KEY']}`,
          resourceId: END_USER_RESOURCE_ID,
        }
      }
    })

    
    const res = await chargepoint.POST('/user/login')
```
