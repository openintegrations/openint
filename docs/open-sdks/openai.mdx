## Integrating with Openai OpenSDK 

Welcome to the Openai OpenSDK documentation. OpenSDKs provides a type-safe and standardized way to interact with various APIs, ensuring a consistent and efficient integration experience.

The Openai OpenSDK allows you to easily integrate with the Openai API, providing a robust set of tools to manage your API interactions with managed auth by OpenInt.

## Code Example

```typescript

    import {initSDK} from '@opensdks/runtime'
    import {openaiSdkDef} from '@opensdks/sdk-openai'

    const openai = initSDK(openaiSdkDef, {
      auth: {
        // for provider-specific auth
        bearer: `${process.env['OPENAI_TOKEN']}`,
        // or for passthrough auth via OPENINT_API_KEY & end user resourceId
        openInt: {
          apiKey: `${process.env['OPENINT_API_KEY']}`,
