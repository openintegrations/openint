## Integrating with Merge OpenSDK 

Welcome to the Merge OpenSDK documentation. OpenSDKs provides a type-safe and standardized way to interact with various APIs, ensuring a consistent and efficient integration experience.

The Merge OpenSDK allows you to easily integrate with the Merge API, providing a robust set of tools to manage your API interactions with managed auth by OpenInt. 

### Available Methods:

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **GET** | /integrations/ | 
| **GET** | /organizations/integrations | 
| **GET** | /account-token/{public_token} | 
| **POST** | /create-link-token | 


## Code Example

```typescript

    import {initSDK} from '@opensdks/runtime'
    import {mergeSdkDef} from '@opensdks/sdk-merge'

    const merge = initSDK(mergeSdkDef, {
      auth: {
        // for provider-specific auth
        bearer: `${process.env['MERGE_TOKEN']}`,
        // or for passthrough auth via OPENINT_API_KEY & end user resourceId
        openInt: {
          apiKey: `${process.env['OPENINT_API_KEY']}`,
          resourceId: END_USER_RESOURCE_ID,
        }
      }
    })

    
    const res = await merge.GET('/integrations/')
```
