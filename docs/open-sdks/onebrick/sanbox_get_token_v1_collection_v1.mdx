## Integrating with Onebrick OpenSDK 

Welcome to the Onebrick OpenSDK documentation. OpenSDKs provides a type-safe and standardized way to interact with various APIs, ensuring a consistent and efficient integration experience.

The Onebrick OpenSDK allows you to easily integrate with the Onebrick API, providing a robust set of tools to manage your API interactions with managed auth by OpenInt. 

### Available Methods:

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **GET** | /auth/token | Get Public token


## Code Example

```typescript

    import {initSDK} from '@opensdks/runtime'
    import {onebrickSdkDef} from '@opensdks/sdk-onebrick'

    const onebrick = initSDK(onebrickSdkDef, {
      auth: {
        // for provider-specific auth
        bearer: `${process.env['ONEBRICK_TOKEN']}`,
        // or for passthrough auth via OPENINT_API_KEY & end user resourceId
        openInt: {
          apiKey: `${process.env['OPENINT_API_KEY']}`,
          resourceId: END_USER_RESOURCE_ID,
        }
      }, params: { ... }
    })

    // Get Public token
    const res = await onebrick.GET('/auth/token')
```
