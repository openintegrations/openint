## Integrating with Apollo OpenSDK 

Welcome to the Apollo OpenSDK documentation. OpenSDKs provides a type-safe and standardized way to interact with various APIs, ensuring a consistent and efficient integration experience.

The Apollo OpenSDK allows you to easily integrate with the Apollo API, providing a robust set of tools to manage your API interactions with managed auth by OpenInt. 

### Available Methods:

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **GET** | /v1/emailer_campaigns/{id} | 
| **POST** | /v1/emailer_campaigns | 
| **POST** | /v1/emailer_campaigns/{id}/add_contact_ids | 
| **POST** | /v1/emailer_steps | 
| **DELETE** | /v1/emailer_steps/{id} | 
| **PUT** | /v1/emailer_touches/{id} | 
| **GET** | /v1/contacts/{id} | 
| **POST** | /v1/contacts/search | 
| **GET** | /v1/email_accounts | 
| **POST** | /v1/emailer_campaigns/check_contacts_deployability | Check if contacts are deployable to a sequence, primarily used to check if contacts are already in another sequence.


## Code Example

```typescript

    import {initSDK} from '@opensdks/runtime'
    import {apolloSdkDef} from '@opensdks/sdk-apollo'

    const apollo = initSDK(apolloSdkDef, {
      auth: {
        // for provider-specific auth
        bearer: `${process.env['APOLLO_TOKEN']}`,
        // or for passthrough auth via OPENINT_API_KEY & end user resourceId
        openInt: {
          apiKey: `${process.env['OPENINT_API_KEY']}`,
          resourceId: END_USER_RESOURCE_ID,
        }
      }, params: { ... }
    })

    
    const res = await apollo.GET('/v1/emailer_campaigns/{id}')
```
