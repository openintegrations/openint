## Integrating with Hubspot OpenSDK 

Welcome to the Hubspot OpenSDK documentation. OpenSDKs provides a type-safe and standardized way to interact with various APIs, ensuring a consistent and efficient integration experience.

The Hubspot OpenSDK allows you to easily integrate with the Hubspot API, providing a robust set of tools to manage your API interactions with managed auth by OpenInt. 

### Available Methods:

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **GET** | /sample-response | Get sample card detail response
| **GET** | /{appId} | Get all cards
| **POST** | /{appId} | Create a new card
| **GET** | /{appId}/{cardId} | Get a card.
| **DELETE** | /{appId}/{cardId} | Delete a card
| **PATCH** | /{appId}/{cardId} | Update a card


## Code Example

```typescript

    import {initSDK} from '@opensdks/runtime'
    import {hubspotSdkDef} from '@opensdks/sdk-hubspot'

    const hubspot = initSDK(hubspotSdkDef, {
      auth: {
        // for provider-specific auth
        bearer: `${process.env['HUBSPOT_TOKEN']}`,
        // or for passthrough auth via OPENINT_API_KEY & end user resourceId
        openInt: {
          apiKey: `${process.env['OPENINT_API_KEY']}`,
          resourceId: END_USER_RESOURCE_ID,
        }
      }
    })

    // Get sample card detail response
    const res = await hubspot.GET('/sample-response')
```
