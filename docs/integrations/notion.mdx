# Notion Integration (Developer Guide)

Integrate Notion into your application using OpenInt. This guide walks you through OAuth registration, supported scopes, implementation details, and common issues specific to Notion.

## Prerequisites

- A Notion account with workspace admin access
- Access to [Notion integrations dashboard](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
- OpenInt project set up

## Register your Notion OAuth App

1. Go to the [Notion integration dashboard](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations).
2. Click **New integration**.
3. Fill out basic info (name, logo, etc). Set **Type** to `Public`.
4. Specify your application's **redirect URI** & complete required fields.
5. After creation, navigate to the **Configuration** tab. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**—you will need these for OpenInt.

Refer to [Notion’s official OAuth setup guide](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#public-integration-auth-flow-set-up) for annotated screenshots.

## OAuth2: How OpenInt Authenticates Notion

OpenInt uses the standard Notion public OAuth2.0 flow:

* **Authorization endpoint:** `https://api.notion.com/v1/oauth/authorize`
* **Token endpoint:** `https://api.notion.com/v1/oauth/token`

Example (handled by OpenInt):

```js Exchange Notion OAuth Code for Token
const encoded = Buffer.from(`${CLIENT_ID}:${CLIENT_SECRET}`).toString('base64');
fetch('https://api.notion.com/v1/oauth/token', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    Accept: 'application/json',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    Authorization: `Basic ${encoded}`,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    grant_type: 'authorization_code',
    code: 'TEMP_CODE',
    redirect_uri: 'YOUR_REDIRECT_URI',
  }),
});
```

If using OpenInt’s Connect UI, you only provide the client credentials; OpenInt manages the rest internally.

## Supported Notion Scopes / Capabilities

OpenInt currently supports:

| Scope        | Supported by OpenInt | Description |
| ------------ |:-------------------:| ----------- |
| <Tooltip tip="Allows the application to read user information, such as the user's name, email, and profile picture. This is a read-only scope with no write permissions.">user:read</Tooltip> | ✅ | User info (read-only) |
| <Tooltip tip="Allows the application to update user information, such as the user's name or profile picture. This includes the permissions of user:read.">user:write</Tooltip> | ❌ | User info (write) |
| <Tooltip tip="Allows the application to read all content that the user has access to in Notion, including pages, databases, and blocks. This is a read-only scope.">content:read</Tooltip> | ❌ | Read pages, databases |
| <Tooltip tip="Allows the application to create, update, and delete content in Notion, including pages, databases, and blocks. This includes the permissions of content:read.">content:write</Tooltip> | ❌ | Create/update content |
| <Tooltip tip="Allows the application to read workspace information, such as the workspace name, settings, and members. This is a read-only scope.">workspace:read</Tooltip> | ❌ | Workspace info (read) |
| <Tooltip tip="Allows the application to update workspace information, such as settings and members. This includes the permissions of workspace:read.">workspace:write</Tooltip> | ❌ | Workspace info (write) |

See the [official Notion scopes/capabilities reference](https://developers.notion.com/reference/capabilities) for an up-to-date list.

## Quickstart Integration Steps

1. Register your Notion OAuth integration as above.
2. In your OpenInt dashboard, add a Notion connector and paste the Client ID and Secret. Redirect URI must match what you set in Notion.
3. Embed OpenInt Connect UI in your app, or call the API to initiate the OAuth connection.
4. Users authorize Notion—OpenInt stores the access tokens securely for calling Notion APIs.

```js OpenInt Notion Connector Example
openint.createConnection({
  provider: 'notion',
  clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
  clientSecret: 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET',
  redirectUri: 'YOUR_REDIRECT_URI',
});
```

## Common Pitfalls

- **Redirect URI mismatch:** Must match exactly between Notion and OpenInt config, including trailing slashes.
- **Insufficient/not supported scopes:** Only `user:read` is currently supported. Don't request more.
- **No workspace/page selected:** Users must select at least one page/database during OAuth or all API access will fail.
- **Token errors:** Ensure Client Secret and Redirect URI are valid, and token isn’t expired/revoked.

For OAuth/user auth errors, review the [Notion OAuth error docs](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#user-authorization-failures).
