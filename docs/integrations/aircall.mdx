# Aircall Integration (Developer Guide)

Integrate Aircall’s cloud call center platform into your product using OpenInt. This guide walks developers through OAuth setup, scope management, and common issues to ensure a smooth embed experience.

## Overview

[Aircall](https://aircall.io/) is a business phone and call center solution that offers voice infrastructure for modern teams. The OpenInt Aircall connector enables your SaaS to sync Aircall data, currently supporting read-only access to contacts via OAuth2.

> **Stage:** General Availability (`ga`)
> 
> **Supported OpenInt scope:** `contacts.read` (Aircall contacts directory read-only)

---

## Quickstart: Connecting Aircall via OpenInt

### Prerequisites
- Aircall admin privileges (for OAuth app approval)
- Public (HTTPS) redirect & install URIs (localhost is not permitted by Aircall!)
- Access to your OpenInt dashboard or configuration management

### 1. Register Your Integration with Aircall

Aircall does **not** support self-serve OAuth app registration. Instead, email [marketplace@aircall.io](mailto:marketplace@aircall.io) with the following details:
- **Install URI:** where users begin the OAuth flow with your app (typically your integration page)
- **Redirect URI:** where Aircall sends users after consent (must be HTTPS & stable)

References:
- [Aircall OAuth/Scopes Doc](https://developer.aircall.io/api-references/#oauth-technology-partners)
- [Aircall OAuth Flow Tutorial](https://developer.aircall.io/tutorials/how-aircall-oauth-flow-works/)

Aircall will review your request and reply with a `client_id` and `client_secret`.

### 2. Configure OAuth in OpenInt

In your OpenInt integration configuration, set the following:

```json
{
  "client_id": "<YOUR AIRCALL CLIENT ID>",
  "client_secret": "<YOUR AIRCALL CLIENT SECRET>",
  "authorization_url": "https://dashboard.aircall.io/oauth/authorize",
  "token_url": "https://api.aircall.io/v1/oauth/token",
  "scope": "public_api",
  "redirect_uri": "<YOUR REGISTERED REDIRECT URI>"
}
```

**Scopes:** OpenInt requests `public_api`, but currently only `contacts.read` is exposed to downstream applications.

### 3. Start the OAuth Flow

Embed or trigger the Aircall connection in your product via OpenInt’s embeddable Connect Portal or your backend integration:

```ts
// Example: starting the OAuth flow via OpenInt
openint.connect("aircall");
```

When a user authenticates, OpenInt will exchange the grant for an access token and sync the available contacts to your SaaS.

## OAuth Scopes: Support Matrix

OpenInt currently supports only `contacts.read`. Aircall’s API defines additional OAuth scopes. Below is a comparison of all available scopes, their descriptions, and OpenInt support status.

| Scope           | Description                                                                                                            | Supported by OpenInt |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------:|
| public_api      | <Tooltip tip="Provides access to public API endpoints, typically read-only access to non-sensitive data.">public_api</Tooltip> |        No            |
| users.read      | <Tooltip tip="Allows read-only access to user info like names, emails, and basic profile data.">users.read</Tooltip>            |        No            |
| calls.read      | <Tooltip tip="Read-only access to call logs, durations, and participants.">calls.read</Tooltip>                              |        No            |
| contacts.read   | <Tooltip tip="Read-only access to contact info in Aircall directory.">contacts.read</Tooltip>                               |       **Yes**        |
| numbers.read    | <Tooltip tip="Read-only access to phone number info associated with the account.">numbers.read</Tooltip>                       |        No            |
| calls.write     | <Tooltip tip="Allows creating and modifying calls, including initiating new calls and updating statuses.">calls.write</Tooltip> |        No            |
| users.write     | <Tooltip tip="Full access to user data including creating, updating, and deleting users.">users.write</Tooltip>                |        No            |
| admin           | <Tooltip tip="Full administrative access to all account features and sensitive operations.">admin</Tooltip>                   |        No            |

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

- **Invalid redirect_uri**: The redirect URI in OpenInt must exactly match what you provided Aircall. It must be public, HTTPS, and registered – localhost/127.0.0.1 is rejected.
- **Missing or incorrect client credentials**: Ensure you’re using the latest `client_id` and `client_secret` as provisioned by Aircall (they are not self-serve, and must be requested).
- **Requesting unsupported scopes**: OpenInt currently surfaces only `contacts.read` – requesting other scopes via OpenInt will result in permission errors.
- **OAuth consent issues**: Only Aircall Admins can authorize apps via OAuth. Check your test user’s role.
