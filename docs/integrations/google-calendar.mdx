# Google Calendar Integration

Integrate Google Calendar capabilities into your application via OpenInt, enabling seamless bi-directional event sync, user calendar settings access, and more. This guide provides the technical steps to authenticate users via OAuth 2.0, manage scopes, and ensure a robust integration for your SaaS product.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Google Cloud Project** – You need a Google Cloud project ([Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)).
- **Google Calendar API enabled** – Make sure the [Google Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/workspace/calendar/api) is enabled for your project.
- **OAuth 2.0 credentials** – Create an OAuth client ID and secret for your application.
- **Redirect URI** – Register your application's OAuth redirect URI in the Google Cloud Console to match OpenInt's requirements.
- **OpenInt account** – Ensure you have access to your OpenInt deployment to configure the connector.

## Quickstart: Connecting Google Calendar via OpenInt

### 1. Configure your Google Cloud Project

Follow Google’s official [OAuth 2.0 setup guide](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) to:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
2. Select your project or create a new one.
3. From the left menu, navigate to **APIs & Services > Library**, search for "Google Calendar API", and enable it.
4. Under **APIs & Services > Credentials**, click **Create Credentials > OAuth client ID**.
5. Configure the consent screen (set app name, support email, etc.), required before creating credentials.
6. Select your application type (usually "Web application") and add your authorized redirect URIs (e.g. `https://YOUR_OPENINT_URL/api/oauth/callback/google-calendar`).
7. Save the client ID and secret for integration configuration.

Reference: [Google OAuth 2.0 Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)

### 2. Add your OAuth credentials to OpenInt

Configure OpenInt to use the client ID and secret you obtained above for the Google Calendar connector. Example configuration snippet:

```json
{
  "provider": "google-calendar",
  "client_id": "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID",
  "client_secret": "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET",
  "redirect_uri": "https://YOUR_OPENINT_URL/api/oauth/callback/google-calendar"
}
```

### 3. Select and Grant Scopes

Minimum required scope for most read-only integrations via OpenInt:

```
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.settings.readonly
```

Request broader scopes as required (see table below for all available and supported scopes).

## OAuth 2.0 Scopes for Google Calendar

The following table lists all relevant Google Calendar OAuth scopes, their purpose, and whether they are currently supported by OpenInt. Consult the [official Google API scope reference](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes#calendar) for additional details.

| Scope | Description | Supported by OpenInt? |
|-------|-------------|:---------------------:|
| <Tooltip tip="Full access to calendars including management of events, ACLs, and settings.">[calendar](https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar)</Tooltip> | Full read/write access to user's calendars, events, ACLs, and settings. | ❌ |
| <Tooltip tip="Read/write access to calendar events only.">[calendar.events](https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events)</Tooltip> | Read/write access to events only. | ❌ |
| <Tooltip tip="Read-only access to calendar events.">[calendar.events.readonly](https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events.readonly)</Tooltip> | Read-only events access. | ❌ |
| <Tooltip tip="Read-only access to calendars, events, ACLs, and settings.">[calendar.readonly](https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly)</Tooltip> | Read-only access to calendars, events, ACLs, and settings. | ❌ |
| <Tooltip tip="Read-only access to calendar settings.">[calendar.settings.readonly](https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.settings.readonly)</Tooltip> | Read-only access to calendar settings (e.g., timezone, working hours). | ✅ |

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

- **Calendar API not enabled**: Ensure the Google Calendar API is enabled in your Cloud project.
- **Incorrect redirect URIs**: OAuth consent will fail if your application's redirect URI does not precisely match what is registered in the Google Cloud Console.
- **Insufficient scope**: Attempting to use features (e.g., creating or updating events) without granting the necessary scopes will result in authorization errors.
- **Unverified app/consent screen issues**: If your OAuth consent screen is not fully set up and verified (especially in production), users may receive warnings or not be able to complete authentication.
- **Not requesting 'offline' access**: Ensure `access_type=offline` is included so refresh tokens are issued and long-lived access is possible.
- **Prompt not set**: Use `prompt=consent` on initial authorization to always retrieve a refresh token (see Google's [incremental and offline access guide](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server#incrementalAuth)).
