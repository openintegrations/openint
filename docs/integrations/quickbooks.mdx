# QuickBooks Integration (OAuth2)

Integrate QuickBooks Online seamlessly into your application using OpenInt. This guide helps you configure, authenticate, and troubleshoot your QuickBooks connection, providing technical reference and step-by-step guidance.

## Prerequisites

- A [QuickBooks developer account](https://developer.intuit.com/) and access to the [Intuit Developer Dashboard](https://developer.intuit.com/dashboard).
- A QuickBooks company (for sandbox/testing, [create a sandbox company](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/develop/sandboxes/manage-your-sandboxes)).
- An OAuth2 App registered on the Intuit Developer Portal.

## Registering Your OAuth App & Getting Credentials

Follow these steps to register your app and obtain your client ID and secret:

1. [Sign in to your Intuit Developer account](https://developer.intuit.com/dashboard).
2. Select **My Hub > App dashboard** from the upper-right corner.
3. Click **Create an app** (or open an existing app).
4. Go to **Keys and credentials** in the left sidebar.
5. For sandbox, select **Development**; for production, select **Production**. Enable **Show credentials**.
6. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

For detailed steps, refer to [Get the Client ID and Client Secret for your app](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/get-started/get-client-id-and-client-secret).

You must also configure approved redirect URIs in the app settings (e.g., your OpenInt OAuth callback endpoint).

## Configuring the QuickBooks Connector in OpenInt

The OpenInt QuickBooks connector uses OAuth2. You will need to supply the following fields:

- **Client ID / Client Secret** (from above)
- **realmId**: The 16-digit Company ID for your QuickBooks company (e.g., `9341453474484455`).
- **envName**: `sandbox` (default) or `production` depending on which QuickBooks environment you are targeting.

**Example config:**
```yaml
quickbooks:
  clientId: <your-client-id>
  clientSecret: <your-client-secret>
  envName: sandbox                # or 'production'
  realmId: 9341453474484455       # Your QuickBooks company ID
```

## Initiating the OAuth2 Flow

Your application must redirect users to QuickBooks' authorization URL:

```
https://appcenter.intuit.com/connect/oauth2
```

Include the necessary scopes (see next section) and specify your callback/redirect URI. After the user approves access, exchange the authorization code for tokens at:

```
https://oauth.platform.intuit.com/oauth2/v1/tokens/bearer
```

Follow [OpenIntâ€™s authentication docs](/docs/core-concepts-v0/magic-link) and [QuickBooks OAuth guide](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/develop/authentication-and-authorization/oauth-2.0) for implementation details.

## Supported OAuth Scopes

Below is the list of OAuth scopes supported by the OpenInt QuickBooks integration. Choose only those your app requires for least-privilege access.

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| <Tooltip tip="Full access to accounting data including customers, vendors, invoices, payments, expenses, and all other accounting entities. Allows read and write operations.">`com.intuit.quickbooks.accounting`</Tooltip> | Full access to accounting data (read & write) |
| <Tooltip tip="Read-only access to accounting data including customers, vendors, invoices, payments, expenses, and other accounting entities. No write operations allowed.">`com.intuit.quickbooks.accounting.readonly`</Tooltip> | Read-only accounting data access |
| <Tooltip tip="Access to payment operations including processing payments and viewing payment information. Required for integrating with QuickBooks Payments.">`com.intuit.quickbooks.payment`</Tooltip> | Payments operations access |
| <Tooltip tip="Access to payroll data including employee information, pay runs, and payroll items. Allows read and write operations.">`com.intuit.quickbooks.payroll`</Tooltip> | Payroll data access (read & write) |
| <Tooltip tip="Read-only access to payroll data including employee information, pay runs, and payroll items. No write operations allowed.">`com.intuit.quickbooks.payroll.readonly`</Tooltip> | Read-only payroll data access |
| <Tooltip tip="Access to sales receipt operations including creating, updating, and viewing sales receipts.">`com.intuit.quickbooks.salesreceipt`</Tooltip> | Sales receipt access |
| <Tooltip tip="Basic authentication and user profile information (name, email). Does not provide access to any QuickBooks company data.">`openid`</Tooltip> | OpenID Connect: identity only |
| <Tooltip tip="Access to the user's email address only. Minimal scope that doesn't provide access to any QuickBooks company data.">`email`</Tooltip> | Read user email |
| <Tooltip tip="Access to basic user profile information (name, address, phone). Doesn't provide access to any QuickBooks company data.">`profile`</Tooltip> | Read user profile |
| <Tooltip tip="Access to the user's phone number only. Minimal scope that doesn't provide access to any QuickBooks company data.">`phone`</Tooltip> | Read user phone |
| <Tooltip tip="Access to the user's address information only. Doesn't provide access to any QuickBooks company data.">`address`</Tooltip> | Read user address |

If you require additional scopes for other QuickBooks APIs, review the [upstream QuickBooks scopes documentation](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/learn/scopes). Currently, all public and most private QuickBooks OAuth scopes used for core accounting and payments are supported.

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

- **Invalid realmId**: The realmId must be exactly 16 digits. Confirm with your QuickBooks company admin.
- **Redirect URI mismatch**: The redirect URI configured in the Intuit developer dashboard **must** exactly match the callback you provide to OpenInt.
- **Insufficient scopes**: If users do not see the expected QuickBooks company or data, verify that the correct scopes (e.g., `com.intuit.quickbooks.accounting`) are requested.
- **User role**: The authenticating user must be an admin in the target QuickBooks company.
- **Token refresh errors**: See [OAuth errors](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/develop/troubleshooting/oauth-errors) and [QuickBooks API status](https://status.developer.intuit.com/).
- **Production vs Sandbox client credentials**: Each environment uses different credentials and companies.
