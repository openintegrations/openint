# Salesloft Integration for Developers

Integrate Salesloft into your SaaS application using OpenInt to enable secure, white-labeled access to Salesloft resources on behalf of your users. This guide walks you through OAuth setup and best practices for smooth integration.

## Quickstart

1. **Register a Salesloft OAuth App**
2. **Configure OAuth credentials in OpenInt**
3. **Set required scopes**
4. **Test the connection via your OpenInt-powered integration UI**

### Example Connector Configuration

```json
{
  "provider": "salesloft",
  "auth": {
    "client_id": "<your-client-id>",
    "client_secret": "<your-client-secret>",
    "redirect_uri": "https://<your-app-domain>/api/openint/oauth/callback",
    "scopes": ["users:read"]
  }
}
```

## Registering your OAuth App with Salesloft

To allow your users to connect their Salesloft accounts, you must register your application with Salesloft and obtain a **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

**Steps:**
1. **Go to the Salesloft Developer Portal:**
   - Log in to [Salesloft](https://app.salesloft.com/) with your admin or developer account.
   - Navigate to `Settings` > `Integrations` or `Developer` > `OAuth Applications` (the exact path may depend on your account type; for the latest instructions, see [Salesloft API Docs](https://developers.salesloft.com/docs/oauth/overview/)).
2. **Create a new OAuth application.**
   - Provide a descriptive name and (optionally) icon or description for your integration.
   - Enter your **redirect URI** provided by OpenInt (e.g. `https://<your-app-domain>/api/openint/oauth/callback`).
3. **Save and retrieve your credentials.**
   - After creation, you’ll receive a **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for your application. Copy these for use in your OpenInt configuration.

## Supported OAuth2 Scopes

Below is a list of OAuth scopes known to be supported by Salesloft. OpenInt currently supports the listed subset. You may request additional scopes from OpenInt support.

> **Note:** If Salesloft updates their scopes, refer to their [API documentation scopes section](https://developers.salesloft.com/docs/oauth/scopes/) for the canonical list (link subject to change).

| Scope            | Description                                                                                                                        | Supported by OpenInt? |

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

- **Incorrect redirect URI:** The redirect URI registered in Salesloft _must_ exactly match what is configured in OpenInt.
- **Insufficient scopes:** If you select scopes not yet supported by OpenInt, access will be denied. Use only those with a ✅.
- **Client Secret mishandling:** Never commit client secrets to public repos.
- **Salesloft admin approval:** Ensure your OAuth Salesloft app is approved and activated in your Salesloft organization.

For additional troubleshooting, consult the OpenInt logs for specific errors or reach out to support.
