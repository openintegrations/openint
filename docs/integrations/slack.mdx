# Slack Integration via OpenInt

Integrate Slack into your product using OpenInt to give your users seamless access to Slack API functionality through a secure OAuth2 connection, without the need to handle tokens or scopes directly.

> **Audience:** This guide is for technical teams responsible for embedding and configuring integrations inside your SaaS via OpenInt.

---

## Prerequisites

1. [Create a Slack app](https://api.slack.com/apps) in your Slack workspace.
2. In your app’s **OAuth & Permissions**, add your OpenInt backend endpoint as a Redirect URL (e.g., `https://your-domain.com/api/openint/oauth/callback`).
3. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the Slack app settings; you’ll need to provide these to OpenInt.
4. [Review Slack OAuth documentation](https://api.slack.com/authentication/oauth-v2).

---

## Quickstart

OpenInt handles the Slack OAuth2 Authorization Code flow for you:

1. Provide your Slack **Client ID** and **Client Secret** to OpenInt’s Slack configuration.
2. Set the Slack scopes you wish to use (see table below). _Currently, only `users:read` is supported by OpenInt._
3. Embed the OpenInt connect portal or button in your app.

## OAuth2 for Slack

- **Authorization URL:** `https://slack.com/oauth/v2/authorize`
- **Token Exchange URL:** `https://slack.com/api/oauth.v2.access`
- **Scope Separator:** Comma (`,`) — e.g., `users:read,channels:read`

### Locating Your Client ID & Secret
1. Visit the [Slack Apps dashboard](https://api.slack.com/apps) and select your app.
2. Under **Basic Information**, copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
3. In **OAuth & Permissions**, configure your redirect URLs to exactly match your integration.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Redirect URI mismatch**: Slack requires the redirect URI for authorization and token exchange to match _exactly_.
- **Requesting unsupported scopes**: Only `users:read` is supported via OpenInt for Slack.
- **Copy-paste issues**: Watch out for whitespace in client IDs/secrets.
- **Delayed propagation**: Permissions/redirect changes may take minutes to take effect in Slack.
