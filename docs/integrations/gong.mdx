# Gong Integration (Developer Guide)

Integrate Gongâ€”an AI-powered revenue intelligence and conversation analytics platformâ€”into your application via OpenInt. This guide covers OAuth setup, required permissions/scopes, configuration hints, and troubleshooting.

---

## Overview

OpenInt enables you to securely connect customer Gong accounts to your product. With this integration, you can:
- Access Gong user profile metadata (`user:read` scope)
- (Coming soon) Access calls data, analytics, admin features, and conversation details

This guide focuses on the *OAuth 2* flow and required settings.

---

## Prerequisites

- You must have admin access to your Gong organization (to create an app and retrieve credentials).
- You have an OpenInt account and access to your integrationâ€™s configuration.

---

## Registering Your OpenInt App in Gong

Follow these steps to create an OAuth application in Gong and retrieve the credentials needed for OpenInt:

1. **Log in as a Gong technical admin.**
2. Go to **Company Settings â†’ Ecosystem â†’ API â†’ Integrations tab** ([step-by-step official guide](https://help.gong.io/hc/en-us/articles/13944551222157-Create-an-app-for-Gong)).
3. Click **Create Integration** and fill out name, description, upload logos, etc.
4. In **Required authorization scopes**, select the scopes your OpenInt integration will use (see table below). Currently, OpenInt supports only `user:read` (read-only user info), but you may wish to provision additional scopes for future use.
5. Enter your **OAuth Redirect URI** (provided by OpenInt dashboard or your app config).
6. Complete required fields: privacy policy, T&C URLs, etc.
7. Click **Save**: Gong will generate your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Copy these for use in OpenInt.

## OAuth 2.0 Settings For Gong

- **Authorization URL**: `https://app.gong.io/oauth2/authorize`
- **Token URL**: `https://app.gong.io/oauth2/generate-customer-token`
- **Scope Separator**: Space (` `)
- **Required OpenInt scope**: `user:read` (minimum for basic functionality)
- **Redirect URI**: Set in Gong to match your OpenInt registration
- **Base API URL**: `api_base_url_for_customer` (see below)

#### API Base URL Requirement
When a customer finishes authenticating, Gong provides an `api_base_url_for_customer` in the OAuth response. Save this value in your OpenInt configâ€”it is required for all further API operations with Gong.

## Supported Scopes

Below is a comparison table of Gongâ€™s known OAuth 2 scopes and their support in OpenInt.
Refer to [Gongâ€™s API Documentation](https://app.gong.io/settings/api/documentation#overview) for current and future scope details. _(Note: Official API doc access requires login with a Gong admin account.)_

| Scope              | Description                                                                         | Supported by OpenInt? |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| <span title="Allows read-only access to basic user profile information">user:read</span> | Read-only access to user profile information                                 | âœ…                  |
| <span title="Provides access to read call recordings and metadata">calls:read</span>    | Access to read call recordings and metadata                                   | ðŸš«                  |
| <span title="Grants permission to view analytics and reporting data">analytics:read</span> | View analytics and reporting data                                             | ðŸš«                  |
| <span title="Provides full administrative access including user management and system settings">admin:write</span> | Full administrative access (user/system management)                           | ðŸš«                  |
| <span title="Grants complete read/write access to all conversation data including recordings, transcripts, and comments">conversations:full</span> | Complete read/write access to all conversation data                           | ðŸš«                  |

> **Tip:** Hover on each scope for a short description. For the latest scope list and permissions, always consult Gongâ€™s [API documentation](https://app.gong.io/settings/api/documentation#overview) or the [Create an app for Gong](https://help.gong.io/hc/en-us/articles/13944551222157-Create-an-app-for-Gong) guide.

## Minimal Setup Example

Configure your OpenInt integration for Gong as follows (replace placeholders with your real data):

```json
{
  "client_id": "<your Gong Client ID>",
  "client_secret": "<your Gong Client Secret>",
  "redirect_uri": "<your OAuth redirect URI>",
  "scopes": ["user:read"],
  "api_base_url_for_customer": "https://<yourcustomer>.api.gong.io"
}
```

### OAuth2 Flow (Summary)
1. Direct user to Gong authorize URL with required parameters.
2. User completes Gong consent for required scopes.
3. Receive code at your registered redirect URI.
4. Exchange code at Gongâ€™s token endpoint to obtain access & refresh tokens and `api_base_url_for_customer`.
5. Save all these values for your user in OpenIntâ€™s connection store.

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

- **App not registering or missing credentials:**
  - Only Gong technical admins can register an app and view Client Secret/ID.
- **Invalid redirect URI:**
  - Ensure your redirect URI is exactly as configured in both Gong and OpenInt.
- **Missing `api_base_url_for_customer`:**
  - This must be saved after successful OAuthâ€”Gong uses a unique base URL per customer.
- **Incorrect scope errors:**
  - Only request `user:read` unless OpenInt adds more scope support in the future.
- **400/401 authentication errors:**
  - Double-check credentials; the most common cause is mismatched Client ID/Secret or failure to use Basic Auth (base64) during token exchange.
