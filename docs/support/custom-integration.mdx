OpenInt already supports thousands of financial institutions (banks, investment
accounts, etc.) out-of-the-box, but our platform's flexibility doesn't end there.

OpenInt can help build custom integrations to pipe data into OpenInt
from a financial data source of your choosing.
This allows you to easily integrate your existing data source needs with OpenInt and
make use of OpenInt's unified and standardized data engineering & infrastructure
to do all the heavy lifting.

Your can request custom integration pipelines by contacting [OpenInt's support
team](mailto:hello@openint.dev) and providing information about the data source you
want access to (e.g. Stripe, Quickbooks, NetSuite). OpenInt's team will then work
with you to build a custom integration pipeline to suit your needs.

Custom integration pipelines can be set up for specific data sources such as
accounting software, banking data, or payment gateways, and can be scheduled to
run at specific intervals, such as daily, weekly, or monthly.

We're on your team, so you can relax and do what you love best while we handle all the
hard stuff.

### Examples

- Importing from accounting software (Quickbooks, Xero, etc)
- Exporting to your own SQL database
- Importing from payments providers (Stripe, Paypal, etc.)
- Importing from commerce software (Shopify)
