# Webhooks & Events

OpenInt's webhook system allows you to receive real-time updates about changes in your connected services.

## Event Types

1. **Connection Events**

   - Connection created
   - Connection updated
   - Connection deleted
   - Authentication status changes

## Implementing Webhooks

You can register a webhook endpoint on the Openint console.

## Event Payload Structure

```typescript
interface WebhookPayload {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  created: string;
  data: {
    // Event-specific data
  };
  metadata: {
    // Additional context
  };
}
```

## Best Practices

- Implement proper signature verification
- Handle retries appropriately
- Process events asynchronously
- Monitor webhook health
- Implement proper error handling
- Keep secrets secure
