# Connectors

Connectors are the foundation of OpenInt's integration capabilities. They provide standardized interfaces to interact with various third-party services.

## Connector Architecture

Each connector in OpenInt follows a consistent architecture:

- **Authentication Layer** - Handles OAuth2, API keys, and other auth methods
- **Data Mapping** - Transforms data between systems
- **Rate Limiting** - Intelligent request throttling
- **Error Handling** - Standardized error responses

## Connector Types

OpenInt supports several types of connectors:

1. **REST API Connectors**

   - Standard HTTP/REST implementations
   - JSON payload support
   - Custom header management

2. **GraphQL Connectors**

   - Native GraphQL support
   - Query optimization
   - Schema validation

3. **Event-Driven Connectors**
   - Webhook support
   - Real-time data streaming
   - Event queueing

## Best Practices

- Always handle rate limits appropriately
- Implement proper error handling
- Use pagination for large data sets
- Cache responses when possible
- Monitor API usage
