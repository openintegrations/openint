# Customization Options

All customization options are available on the frontend components or also on the `createMagicLink` API (see [API Reference](/api-reference/create-magic-link)).

## Setting Display Names for Connectors

You may want to set a display name for a connector so that instead of showing the connector's name, the display name is shown.

For example, instead of 'Plaid' being shown you can configure it to say 'US Bank Account'.

This can be done by setting the `Display Name` in the connector configuration section of the console.
