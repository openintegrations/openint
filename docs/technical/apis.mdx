description: How data is structured within Venice's unified API
---

Please see the [REST API docs](https://app.venice.is/api-access/rest) for
data models & schema information.

Note that Venice currently supports the following APIs:

- [GraphQL](https://app.venice.is/api-access/graphql)
- [REST](https://app.venice.is/api-access/rest)

If you'd like access to other APIs, please [contact us](mailto:hi@venice.is).

- Realtime API (e.g. via websockets) to receive real-time notifications on
database row insert / update / deletions
- Dedicated database to execute raw SQL queries (for backends, data analysis, etc.)
