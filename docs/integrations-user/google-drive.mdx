# Connect your Google Drive account

Connect your Google Drive to your account to enable seamless file import, synchronization, and document access within this app. You’ll only need to do this once.

## Prerequisites

- A Google account (personal, work, or school).

## How to Connect

1. Navigate to the integrations section or settings within your app.
2. Select **Google Drive** from the list of available integrations.
3. Click **Connect** (or similar) to begin the process.
4. When prompted, a Google window will appear. Sign in to Google, if necessary.
5. Review the requested permissions, then click **Allow** to grant access.
6. You will be redirected back to your app, where the integration setup completes automatically.

Once connected, your app can now securely access files and folders on your Google Drive, as permitted by your selections.

## Permissions Requested

When connecting, the app will ask for one or more of the following permissions:

| Permission scope | Why it’s requested |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Full access to all files and folders (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`) | Allows the app to view, create, update, or delete any file or folder in your Google Drive. Usually needed for full-featured integrations. |
| Access only to files created/opened via the app (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`) | Restricts access to just files and folders you’ve interacted with using this app. Safer for limited-use cases. |
| App data folder access (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.appdata`) | Lets the app store and manage configuration files privately. |
| Read-only access to file metadata (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.metadata.readonly`/`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.metadata`) | Lets the app see file names, folders, and properties, but not file contents. |
| Read access to all files and metadata (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`) | Allows the app to view but not modify your files and folders. |
| Read-only access to Google Photos in Drive (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.photos.readonly`) | Permits the app to view photos and videos stored in your Google Drive. |
| Access to Google Apps Script projects (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.scripts`) | Lets the app manage and run Google Apps Script projects in your Drive. |

You will always be shown a consent screen by Google listing the specific permissions being requested. The app will only access information needed to provide its features.

## Testing the Connection

After connecting, you can verify everything works by:
- Importing a file from Google Drive
- Creating a document within the app and saving it to Google Drive
- Navigating to the integration settings page and checking for a “Connected” or “Synced” status

## Troubleshooting

- **Multiple Google Accounts:** If you have several Google accounts, double check you’re logged into the correct one when connecting.
- **Permission denied:** If you see errors about permissions, reconnect and approve all requested permissions.
- **Revoking Access:** To disconnect, go to the integrations section in your app, or visit your [Google Account permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions) to remove access for this app.
- **“App not verified” warning:** Some apps may display a Google warning if the app isn’t fully verified with Google. If you trust the app, you can proceed, or contact support for assistance.

If you encounter other issues, check for messages in the app or visit the Help or Support section.
