# Connect Your Intercom Account

You can connect your Intercom account to your app to sync your contacts, conversations, and other important data. This enables features such as viewing conversations, managing users or contacts, and more—directly from within your app.

## Quick Start

Follow these steps to connect your Intercom account:

1. Go to the settings or integrations section in your app.
2. Find and select **Intercom** from the list of available integrations.
3. Click on **Connect Intercom** (or similarly-labeled button).
4. A secure Intercom login page will open. Log in with your Intercom credentials if you're not already signed in.
5. Review the access permissions being requested (see below). Click **Authorize** to grant access.
6. Once authorized, you’ll be redirected back to your app. A confirmation message should indicate a successful connection.

## Permissions Requested

When connecting to Intercom, the integration requires one or more of the following permissions:

| Permission         | Why It’s Needed                                                        |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| read               | Allows your app to view data in Intercom, such as users and conversations. (Read-only) |
| write              | Allows your app to create and update data in Intercom, e.g., users and conversations.         |
| users.read         | Enables your app to import and display user data from Intercom.         |
| companies.read     | Allows your app to access and display company data from Intercom.       |
| conversations.read | Lets your app view conversation history in Intercom.                   |
| contacts.write     | Permits creation and updating of Intercom contacts from your app.       |
| admin              | Full access to your Intercom account, including settings and all data.  |

Your app will only request the minimum permissions required for the integration to function. You will be prompted to review and approve these during the connection process.

## How to Confirm the Connection Works

After connecting, you can:
- Check if your app displays your Intercom data (e.g., users, contacts, or conversations).
- Optionally go to your Intercom admin panel and verify that your app is listed as an authorized app under settings.

If you see your data syncing or can initiate actions (such as sending a message via Intercom from your app), your connection is successful.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Not Seeing the Intercom Login?**
- Make sure your browser allows pop-ups, as the connection uses a secure popup window.

**Login Fails or Stalls**
- Confirm that you are using the correct Intercom credentials and that your account has the necessary permissions.

**Authorization Denied**
- If you accidentally denied permission or closed the window, restart the connection process and carefully grant the necessary permissions.

**Integration Doesn't Seem to Work**
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting your Intercom account from your app’s integration settings.
- Double-check that the correct permissions were granted.
- Contact your app’s support team if the issue persists.
