- **Permissions denied:** Some features may not work if permissions are not granted. Try reconnecting and approve all requested permissions.
- **Session expired or connection lost:** You may need to reconnect your Facebook account from the Integrations page.
- **Still need help?** Log out and back in, then retry the connection.
