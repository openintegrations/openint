# Connect Your Pipedrive Account

Easily link your Pipedrive CRM to your account to sync contacts, deals, and streamline your workflow. Connecting is secure and only takes a moment.

## How to Connect

1. In your app, navigate to the integrations or connections page and find **Pipedrive**.
2. Click **Connect** or **Add Account** next to Pipedrive.
3. A new window will open for Pipedrive login and authorization. Sign in with your Pipedrive account (if not already signed in).
4. Review the requested permissions (see list below) and click **Allow and Install** to grant access.
5. Once authorized, you’ll be returned to your app and your Pipedrive account will appear as connected.

## Permissions Explained

To sync your contacts and deals, the following permissions may be requested:

- **Base**: Accesses your Pipedrive profile, email, and company info. _(No deal/contact/org data access.)_
- **Contacts: Read**: Lets the app view (but not change) your people and organization records.
- **Contacts: Write**: Allows creation, updates, or removal of contacts in your CRM.
- **Deals: Read**: Enables the app to list and display your deals for you (read-only).
- **Deals: Write**: Lets the app add, edit, or remove deals in your pipeline.
- **Users: Read**: Allows viewing a list of users/teammates in your Pipedrive workspace.
- **Admin**: (Rare) Full access to manage settings, users, and data. You will be prompted clearly if this is required; only accept if you trust the app and want full automation.

Only the permissions necessary for your use case are requested; you can review these on the Pipedrive authorization screen.

## How to Check Your Connection

- After connecting, you should see your Pipedrive account listed in the integrations area of the app.
- Try importing/syncing contacts or deals to ensure data is flowing as expected.
- If you see an error, check the troubleshooting tips below.

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

- **POP-UP blocked?** Allow pop-ups or disable blockers to complete OAuth.
- **Wrong Pipedrive account connected?** Log out from Pipedrive.com, then retry connecting.
- **Denied permissions?** If you declined permissions, try reconnecting and accept all required scopes.
- **Authorization failed?** Your Pipedrive account may not have sufficient rights—ask your Pipedrive admin for access or try with an admin account.
- **Still not working?** Disconnect and reconnect, or refresh your browser and try again.
