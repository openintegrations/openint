## What permissions are needed, and why?

When you connect QuickBooks, {{YourAppName}} requests the following permissions. These are needed to enable features like importing your customers, invoices, payments, payroll information, and syncing your accounting data:

- <b>Full/Read-only access to accounting data</b>: Read and (if needed) create or update customers, vendors, invoices, payments, expenses, and other accounting items.
- <b>Payments</b>: Access and process payments, required for payment-related features.
- <b>Payroll/Payroll read-only</b>: Manage or view payroll data, such as employee details and pay runs.
- <b>Sales receipts</b>: Create, update, or read sales receipts.
- <b>OpenID, email, profile, phone, and address</b>: Identify your account and user profile, so we link the right data. These do <strong>not</strong> give access to your financial records.

We only request permissions needed to make your integration work. You control which company account you grant access to.

## Verifying your connection

After connecting, you should see QuickBooks marked as <b>Connected</b> in your integrations list. You may want to test the connection by trying a sample import or sync.

## Troubleshooting and common questions

<Note>
<strong>Trouble connecting?</strong> Try these steps:
</Note>

- Make sure you’re using a QuickBooks Online account and have permission to add apps.
- Ensure you selected the correct company (especially if you manage multiple businesses).
- If you denied any requested permissions, you’ll need to restart the connection process.
- If the pop-up was blocked by your browser, allow pop-ups for this site and try again.
- Occasionally, connections can expire over time; just reconnect using the same steps above.

<Warning>
If you change your QuickBooks password or your company’s app permissions, you may need to re-authorize the connection.
</Warning>
