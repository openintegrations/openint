## Connecting Acme with Your App

Follow these simple steps to securely link your Acme account with your app. This will let you use Acme's features directly within your app—your privacy and security are protected throughout the process.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the connection">
    In your app, look for the option to connect Acme. This may appear as a "Connect Acme account" or similar button in your integrations or settings page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign in to Acme">
    You’ll be redirected to the Acme website. Enter your Acme credentials to sign in if prompted.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and authorize access">
    Acme will ask you to approve certain permissions for your app. Please review the requested permissions, then click “Allow” to proceed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Finish and return">
    After approval, you’ll be brought back to your app, where you’ll see a confirmation that Acme is now connected.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Requested Permissions

When you connect your Acme account, the following permissions are requested:

- **Read profile information** (`read:profile`) — Lets the app display your Acme name, avatar, or other basic details so you can confirm which account is connected.
- **Read posts** (`write:posts`) — Lets the app show or sync posts from your Acme account. *(Note: No changes or posts will be made on your behalf unless specifically authorized.)*

<Info>
You are always in control. You can disconnect Acme at any time from your app's settings page.
</Info>

## How to Check Your Connection

After connecting, you should be able to see your Acme profile or imported posts in your app. If you don't, try refreshing the page or navigating to a section of the app that shows your Acme data.

## Troubleshooting

<Tip>
If you accidentally deny permissions or close the Acme window, simply start the connection process again.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Make sure you are signing in to the correct Acme account if you have more than one.
</Warning>

<Note>
If the connection fails, try refreshing your browser, clearing cookies, or disabling browser extensions that affect redirects. If problems persist, contact support for assistance.
</Note>

## Disconnecting Acme

To revoke access, visit your app’s integration settings, find the Acme connection, and choose “Disconnect” or “Remove.” This immediately stops all data sharing between your app and Acme.
