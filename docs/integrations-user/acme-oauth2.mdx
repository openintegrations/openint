# Connecting Acme with Your Account

You can securely link your Acme account to {{customer_app_name}} to unlock new features. This connection lets you sync your Acme information, such as your profile and posts, directly in {{customer_app_name}}.

## Quickstart

<Step title="Open Integrations Settings">
Go to the <strong>Integrations</strong> section within your {{customer_app_name}} account settings.
</Step>
<Step title="Select Acme">
Find and select <strong>Acme</strong> from the list of supported apps.
</Step>
<Step title="Connect and Authorize">
Click <strong>Connect</strong>. You will be securely redirected to Acme to log in (if not already) and to authorize access.
</Step>
<Step title="Grant Permissions">
Review the permissions requested, then click <strong>Allow</strong> or <strong>Authorize</strong> to finish.
</Step>
<Step title="Finish and Verify">
You will return to {{customer_app_name}}. If successful, your Acme information will appear in the app.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Permissions Requested

When you connect, we ask for:

- **Read profile information** (`read:profile`): To display your Acme profile in {{customer_app_name}}.
- **Read posts** (`write:posts`): To show your Acme posts or content within the app.

Review what data you share with {{customer_app_name}} on the Acme authorization screen before granting access.
