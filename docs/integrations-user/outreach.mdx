# Connect Outreach to Your App

Connect your Outreach account to make your workflows more efficient and keep your data in sync — including prospects, engagement history, and sequences. This process is quick and secure: all you need are your Outreach login details.

## How to Connect

1. **Open the Integrations page** in your app. This can usually be found in your app's sidebar or settings menu, often labeled as "Integrations" or "Connected Apps."
2. **Find Outreach** in the list of available integrations.
3. Click **Connect** or **Sign in to Outreach**.
4. You'll be redirected to the Outreach login window. Sign in using your Outreach credentials.
5. Review the permissions requested. Click **Allow** or **Authorize** to confirm and complete the connection.
6. Once authorized, you’ll be returned to your app, and Outreach will show as connected.

## Permissions Explained

When you connect Outreach, you will be asked to authorize the following permissions:

- **Read your Outreach profile**: Access your name, email, and basic profile information.
- **View prospect data**: Read information about your prospects, including their contact and engagement history.
- **Create or edit prospects**: Add or update prospect records directly from your app.
- **View sequences**: Read email sequence steps and templates managed in your Outreach account.
- **Modify sequences**: Create or update sequences and templates to streamline your communication workflows.
- **Full administrative access**: Some features may require admin-level permissions in Outreach.

Your app only uses these permissions to provide integration features you enable. We never store your Outreach credentials.

## Confirm the Connection

After connecting, you can:

- View or sync prospects from Outreach
- Access engagement data
- Automatically update sequences, as enabled in your app

Check the "Integrations" or "Connected Apps" page for Outreach’s status. If connected, you're all set!

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

- **Access denied during connection**: Double check you granted all permissions. If you click "Deny," the integration won't connect. Try again, ensuring you authorize all requested items.
- **Outreach account is restricted**: Your organization admin may restrict integrations. Contact your Outreach admin for access.
- **Expired or disconnected account**: If the connection is lost, you may need to reconnect your Outreach account by repeating the steps above.
- **Wrong Outreach login**: Make sure you log in with the correct Outreach account containing your data.

If you continue to have trouble, look for a help or support option within your app for more detailed troubleshooting.
