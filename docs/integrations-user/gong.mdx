# Connect Your Gong Account

You can easily link your Gong account with your [Customer App] to sync call recordings, analytics, and more. This guide walks you through the secure connection process, explains permissions, and helps you troubleshoot common issues.

## What You'll Need

- Access to your Gong account (with permission to authorize third-party apps)
- Your Gong account's web address (e.g., `https://example.gong.io`)

## How to Connect Gong

1. **Start the Connection**  
   In your [Customer App], go to the Integrations page and select **Gong**. Click "Connect Gong" to begin.

2. **Enter Your Gong Base URL**  
   You'll be asked for your Gong account base URL. This is typically the web address you use to log into Gong, such as `https://yourcompany.gong.io`.

   <Tip>Use the full address, including `https://`. If in doubt, copy the URL from your browser's address bar after logging into Gong.</Tip>

3. **Sign in to Gong & Authorize**  
   A secure Gong window will open. Sign into your Gong account (if you aren't already) and review the permissions requested. Click **Authorize** to approve access.

4. **Return to [Customer App]**  
   After approval, you'll return to [Customer App]. Your Gong account should now be connected!

## Permissions Requested

Connecting Gong grants [Customer App] the following access to your Gong data:

| Permission | Why It's Needed |
|------------|----------------|
| **user:read** | Read-only access to your basic user profile to identify and personalize your workspace. |
| **calls:read** | Lets [Customer App] sync and analyze your Gong call recordings and metadata. |
| **analytics:read** | Allows your app to provide insights using Gong's analytics and reporting data. |
| **admin:write** | Needed for managing users and settings when offering administration features directly from your app. |
| **conversations:full** | Enables viewing and managing all conversation data, including transcripts and comments, to support robust workflows. |

<Info>You can revoke access at any time from your Gong account settings.</Info>

## How to Verify Your Gong Connection

- Check for a confirmation message or "Gong Connected!" badge in your [Customer App]'s integrations section.
- Optionally, try syncing or viewing data (like recent calls) from Gong to ensure the integration is working.

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

<Warning>If you see an error about the Gong base URL, double-check that you entered your full Gong web address (e.g., `https://yourcompany.gong.io`).</Warning>

- **Permissions Denied:**  
  If you declined any permissions, the integration may not work. Retry the connection and accept all requested permissions.

- **Wrong Account:**  
  Ensure you log into the correct Gong workspace if you have access to more than one.

- **Admin Approval Needed:**  
  Your Gong administrator may need to approve new integrations. Contact your admin if you cannot authorize the app.

If the issue persists, refer to your [Customer App]'s support resources.
