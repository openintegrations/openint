## What Permissions Are Requested and Why?

This app will request permission to access certain information from your Discord account. Below is a summary of possible permissions you may see, and what each one means:

| Permission         | Why It's Needed                                   |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Basic Info** (`identify`)           | Access your Discord username, user ID, and avatar. Lets the app identify you and display your profile. |
| **Email Address** (`email`)           | Lets the app associate your email for notifications or support. |
| **Connected Accounts** (`connections`)| Allows the app to see which other services (like Steam, Battle.net) you have linked to Discord. |
| **Server List** (`guilds`)            | Lets the app see which servers you belong to, so you can pick one to link or perform actions in. |
| **Join Servers** (`guilds.join`)      | Lets the app help you join a server automatically, if needed. |
| **Join Group DMs** (`gdm.join`)       | Lets the app help you join group DMs. Rarely requested. |
| **Read Messages** (`messages.read`)   | Lets the app read direct messages sent to you. Only requested if necessary for core features. |
| **Bot Access** (`bot`)                | Lets the app add a bot to your servers to help with automation or moderation. |
| **Post via Webhook** (`webhook.incoming`)| Lets the app post messages as a webhook in a channel you specify. |

You will always have a chance to review these before approving.

## How to Confirm Your Connection

After connecting, you should see your Discord username or avatar displayed in the integrations area of this app. You may also see a message confirming your account is linked.

If you do not see a confirmation, try refreshing the page or check the integration area again.

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

**Authorization window closes or is canceled:** Restart the connection process by clicking the **Connect Discord** button again.

**Wrong Discord account linked:** Log out of Discord in your web browser, then start the connection again to log in as the correct user.

**Permission denied:** If you accidentally denied a permission, try disconnecting the integration (from either this app or your Discord connections page), then reconnect and accept all permissions requested.

**Connection fails to complete:**
- Refresh your browser and try again.
- Make sure pop-ups are not being blocked.
- If you see any error messages, follow the guidance displayed or contact support.

**Still experiencing problems?**

Disconnect the integration, refresh your browser, and try again. If the issue continues, contact this app's support team for help.
