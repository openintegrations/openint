# Connecting Your Xero Account

Easily connect your Xero account to your app to sync accounting data and streamline your workflow. Follow the simple steps below to securely link your Xero account and start syncing your information.

## Quickstart: How to Connect

1. **Go to Integrations in Your App**
   - Navigate to the integrations or connections page within your app's settings.
2. **Choose Xero**
   - Select _Xero_ from the list of available integration options.
3. **Start Connection**
   - Click the “Connect Xero” button. You’ll be redirected to Xero’s secure login page.
4. **Log in to Xero**
   - Enter your Xero account credentials if you aren’t already signed in.
5. **Review and Approve Permissions**
   - Review the requested permissions. Approve access to continue.
6. **Return to Your App**
   - After approval, you’ll be redirected back to your app. You’ll see a confirmation that your Xero account is now connected.

## Permissions Requested

When you connect Xero, your app will request the following access:

- **Access When You’re Not Online (`offline_access`)**
  - Lets your app automatically sync with Xero, even when you’re not actively using it. This provides up-to-date data without repeated logins.
- **Basic Profile Info (`openid`)**
  - Verifies your identity and allows your app to know who is connected. This does not give access to any sensitive Xero data or perform actions on your behalf.

## Testing Your Connection

After connecting, your app will usually begin syncing your Xero data automatically. You can verify the connection is working by:

- Checking if Xero data (such as contacts, invoices, or transactions) appear in your app.
- Looking for a success message or indicator in the integrations section.

If you do not see your data, see the troubleshooting steps below.

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

- **Didn’t finish connecting?**  
  Make sure to complete all steps—especially approving permissions and returning to your app after authorizing Xero.

- **Accidentally denied access?**  
  Go back to the integration page and click “Connect Xero” to restart the process.

- **Not seeing your Xero data?**  
  Try refreshing the page or disconnecting and reconnecting Xero.

- **Authorization popup blocked or does not open?**  
  Ensure your browser is set to allow popups from your app.

- **Wrong Xero account?**  
  Log out of Xero, or use an incognito/private window to connect the intended Xero account.

- **Connection expired?**  
  For security, you might need to reconnect Xero occasionally. Follow the above steps to reauthorize if prompted.

## Security & Your Data

Your credentials are never shared with the app directly. The connection uses Xero’s secure authorization process, and only the minimum permissions needed are requested.

If you ever wish to disconnect, you can remove access at any time from within your app’s integration settings.
