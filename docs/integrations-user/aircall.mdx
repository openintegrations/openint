# Connect Your Aircall Account

Easily connect your Aircall account to your app to sync call data, contacts, and other business communications. This integration lets you view and manage Aircall data directly from your account, helping streamline your workflow.

## How to Connect

Follow these steps to securely link your Aircall account:

1. **Start the Connection**  
   In your app, click the <strong>Connect Aircall</strong> button. You’ll be redirected to Aircall’s secure login page.

2. **Log in to Aircall**  
   Enter your Aircall credentials if you are not already signed in.

3. **Review and Approve Permissions**  
   Review the requested permissions carefully. Click <strong>Authorize</strong> to continue.

4. **Finish Connecting**  
   You will be returned to your app once the connection is successful. A confirmation message should appear.

## Permissions Requested

When you connect your account, you’ll be asked to grant your app access to certain Aircall data. Here’s what’s requested and why:

| Permission         | Why It’s Needed                                                                      |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| public_api         | Basic connection, required for app functionality.                                   |
| users.read         | To display your profile and ensure correct user linking.                            |
| calls.read         | To import and display your call logs and details.                                   |
| contacts.read      | To sync and list your Aircall contacts.                                             |
| numbers.read       | To show your assigned Aircall numbers and enable number-based features.             |
| calls.write        | To allow creation or updates of call records from within the app (if supported).    |
| users.write        | To enable updates to your profile, such as managing account settings (if needed).   |
| admin              | For advanced features requiring full administrative access (rare; shown if needed). |

**Note:** Your app only requests the permissions it needs to provide the selected features. You are always in control of the data you share.

## How to Confirm You’re Connected

After connecting, you should see your Aircall data (e.g., contacts or call logs) appear within your app. If you don’t see your expected data within a few minutes, try refreshing the page or viewing the integration status in your settings area.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during connection:

- **Access Denied:** Ensure you approve all requested permissions when prompted by Aircall.
- **Wrong Account:** Make sure you’re logged into the correct Aircall account before authorizing.
- **Connection Expired or Failed:** Try disconnecting and reconnecting Aircall from your app’s integration settings.
- **No Data Appearing:** Refresh the page or wait a few minutes as the sync may take some time.

If these steps don’t resolve your issue, please contact support through your app’s help center.

## Privacy & Security

Your permissions and account data are handled securely. Only the permissions listed above are requested, and your data is never used for any purpose except to enable the features shown in your app.
