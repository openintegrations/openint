# Connect Your Google Docs Account

Easily link your Google Docs account to {{customer_app}} so you can sync documents and collaborate without leaving the app.

## How to Connect

1. Go to the **Integrations** or **Settings** page in {{customer_app}}.
2. Find **Google Docs** and click **Connect**.
3. A window will open asking you to sign into your Google account (if you are not already signed in).
4. Review the permissions requested and click **Allow** to grant access.
5. Once authorized, you’ll return to {{customer_app}} and Google Docs will be connected!

> **Note:**
> Be sure to use the correct Google account, especially if you manage personal and work accounts.

## What Permissions Are Needed and Why?

When connecting, you will be asked to grant access to one or more of the following permissions:

| Permission (Scope) | What it Allows | Why Needed |
|--------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **View & manage Docs**<br>(`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents`) | View, create, edit, and delete Google Docs documents. | Lets you create or update Docs from {{customer_app}}. |
| **Read-only Docs**<br>(`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly`) | View your Google Docs and their metadata. | Lets you browse Docs inside {{customer_app}}. |
| **Manage specific Drive files**<br>(`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`) | Access to Docs and files created by or shared with {{customer_app}}. | Needed if {{customer_app}} will only read/write files it owns or creates. |
| **Read-only Drive access**<br>(`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`) | View files in your Google Drive, including Docs. | Lets you browse or pick Docs from Drive in {{customer_app}}. |
| **Full Drive access**<br>(`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`) | View, create, edit, or delete all Google Drive files. | Enables full import/export features with your entire Drive. |
| **Current Doc only**<br>(`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly`) | Access only to the currently open Doc. | Used for temporary/limited access, e.g. add-ons. |

You may see a slightly different set of permission requests depending on the features available in {{customer_app}}.

## How to Test the Integration

After connecting Google Docs, try one of these actions to confirm everything’s working:

- Open or import a Google Doc from inside {{customer_app}}.
- Create a new Google Doc using the app (if supported).
- Sync data or changes and verify that documents update in both places.

If something doesn’t work as expected, check the troubleshooting section below.

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

- **Pop-up blocked:** If nothing happens after clicking Connect, your browser may have blocked the pop-up. Unblock pop-ups for this site and try again.
- **Wrong Google account connected:** You can disconnect by going to Integrations > Google Docs > Disconnect, then reconnect with the correct account.
- **Permissions denied:** If you clicked "Deny" or removed permissions, you’ll need to reconnect and grant access.
- **Stuck or blank window:** Refresh the page and reconnect. If issues persist, check any ad or script blockers.
- **Still can’t connect?** Sign out of your Google account, then log back in and try connecting again.
