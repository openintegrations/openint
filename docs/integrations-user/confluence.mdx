## Permissions

When you connect Confluence, you will be asked to grant several permissions to {{appName}}. Here's what each is for:

| Permission                   | Why It's Needed                                                                                |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **read:confluence-content**  | Read Confluence pages, blog posts, and attachments.                                           |
| **write:confluence-content** | Create, update, or delete Confluence content (pages, posts, attachments) via {{appName}}.     |
| **read:confluence-space**    | Access information about your Confluence spaces.                                              |
| **read:confluence-user**     | View your basic user profile information for identity verification.                           |
| **read:confluence-props**    | Read properties and metadata on your Confluence content.                                      |
| **write:confluence-props**   | Read and modify custom properties or metadata linked to your content.                         |
| **read:confluence-groups**   | View your group memberships for workspace-based permission management.                        |
| **manage:confluence-space**  | Manage space settings, including permissions, from within {{appName}} if supported.           |

## Testing the Connection

After connecting, return to {{appName}} and:

1. Navigate to the Confluence integration tile.
2. You should see a status indicator (e.g., "Connected").
3. Try creating or syncing a page to confirm the integration works.

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

- **Wrong Account**: Make sure you are logged into the correct Confluence/Atlassian account before connecting.
- **Permission Denied**: If you declined permissions, the connection may not complete. Try reconnecting and accepting all required permissions.
- **Workspace Restrictions**: Some Confluence admins restrict third-party integrations. If you see authorization errors, contact your Confluence admin.
- **Timeouts or Redirect Issues**: Disable any aggressive ad blockers or try a different browser if you do not see a redirect or confirmation.
