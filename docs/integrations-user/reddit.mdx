# Connect Your Reddit Account

Connecting your Reddit account allows {{APP_NAME}} to provide enhanced features, such as syncing your Reddit posts and comments, managing your subreddit activity, and accessing personalized Reddit data within the platform. All connections are secure and require your explicit authorization.

## Quickstart: How to Connect

Follow these steps to link your Reddit account with {{APP_NAME}}:

1. Go to the integrations or connections area in your {{APP_NAME}} account.
2. Find and select the **Reddit** integration.
3. Click **Connect** or **Link Account**.
4. A new window will open asking you to sign in to your Reddit account (if you are not already signed in).
5. Review the permissions requested by {{APP_NAME}}. These are necessary to enable all integration features (see below for details).
6. Click **Allow** to complete the connection.
7. You will be redirected back to {{APP_NAME}} and see a confirmation message when the connection is successful.

> **Tip:** Make sure you are logged in to the correct Reddit account before authorizing.
