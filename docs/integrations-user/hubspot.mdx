## How to Connect HubSpot

1. **Go to the Integrations page** in {{APP_NAME}} (usually in Settings or Integrations).
2. Find **HubSpot** and select **Connect**.
3. You’ll be redirected to HubSpot’s secure login and permissions screen.
4. **Sign in with your HubSpot account** if prompted.
5. Review the permissions requested and click **Allow**.
6. You’ll be redirected back to {{APP_NAME}} — your HubSpot account is now connected!

## Test Your Connection

Once connected, you should see a confirmation message in {{APP_NAME}} and (if enabled) your HubSpot data will begin syncing. You can:

- Check the integration status under your Integrations page
- View newly imported data (like contacts, companies, or deals)
- Try an action (like syncing or exporting data) to confirm everything is working

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

**1. Incorrect HubSpot account**  
Make sure you’re logged into the correct HubSpot account when authorizing access.

**2. Permissions not granted**  
If you deny required permissions, integration cannot proceed. Please restart the connection process and accept the requested permissions.

**3. Pop-up blockers**  
If nothing happens when you click Connect, disable your browser’s pop-up blockers and try again.

**4. Integration fails or disconnects**  
Try reconnecting from the Integrations page in {{APP_NAME}}. If problems persist, check your HubSpot user role or contact your admin.

**5. Unexpected data issues**  
If data isn’t syncing as expected, verify that you’ve granted all necessary permissions and that your HubSpot account has access to the relevant objects.
