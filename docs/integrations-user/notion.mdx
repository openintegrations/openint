# Connect Notion to your App

You can easily connect your Notion account to this app to access your pages, databases, and more—all from one place. This integration is secure and you stay in control of your data at all times.

## Quickstart: How to connect Notion

1. **Start in the app:** In your account or integrations settings, look for an option to connect to Notion.
2. **Click “Connect Notion”** (or similar): You’ll be redirected to Notion’s secure login page.
3. **Sign in to Notion:** Log in with the Notion account you want to link.
4. **Review permissions:** You’ll see a list of permissions that allow the app to work with your Notion content (see below for a breakdown).
5. **Approve access:** Click “Allow access” to authorize the connection.
6. **Finish:** You’re sent back to the app where you should see Notion listed as a connected integration.

*That’s it! You’re ready to sync Notion content with your app.*

## What permissions are requested?

The app requests the following permissions from Notion. Only the minimum needed to enable features will be used:

- **user:read** – Allows reading your basic Notion profile info (name, email, picture). *Read-only.*
- **user:write** – Lets the app update profile info like your display name or profile image. Includes user:read permissions.
- **content:read** – Allows the app to read pages, databases, and other content you have access to. *Read-only.*
- **content:write** – Lets the app create, update, or delete your Notion content (pages, databases). Includes content:read permissions.
- **workspace:read** – Lets the app read general workspace info (name, settings, members). *Read-only.*
- **workspace:write** – Lets the app update workspace settings or member lists. Includes workspace:read permissions.

Depending on which features you use, not all of these permissions may be required. You control what you grant and can review these in the Notion authorization prompt.

## How do I know it’s working?

Once connected, you should see your Notion spaces, pages, or profile info appear in your app (depending on what the app supports). Try importing, syncing, or linking a Notion page—you should not see any error messages. If prompted, confirm the sync was successful.

If you remove the integration from your app or disconnect it in Notion’s settings, syncing will stop immediately.

## Troubleshooting

**Didn’t get connected? Here are some common issues:**

- **Denied permission:** Be sure to click “Allow access” on the Notion permissions screen.
- **Wrong Notion account:** If you signed into the wrong account, disconnect and retry with the correct one.
- **Insufficient Notion permissions:** Make sure the Notion account you use has access to the pages or workspaces you want to sync.
- **Disconnected integration:** If you remove the connection in Notion or in this app, you’ll need to repeat the setup steps to restore syncing.
- **Permissions changed:** If you change permissions in Notion, or restrict/remove access, some app features may stop working.

If you continue to have trouble, use the support link in the app or check Notion’s [Help & Support Center](https://www.notion.so/help). (You may also try logging out of both apps and retrying the connection.)
