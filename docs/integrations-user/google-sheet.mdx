# Connect Google Sheets

You can connect your Google Sheets account to {{CUSTOMER_APP_NAME}} to easily sync spreadsheets, import data, or automate workflows directly from your Google account.

## How to Connect

1. Open the **Integrations** or **Settings** page in {{CUSTOMER_APP_NAME}}.
2. Find the **Google Sheets** integration and click **Connect**.
3. A Google sign-in window will open. Choose the Google account you want to connect.
4. Review the permissions requested, then click **Allow** to grant access.
5. You’ll be redirected back to {{CUSTOMER_APP_NAME}} and should see a confirmation message.

## Permissions Required

When you connect Google Sheets, the app may request one or more of the following permissions:

| Permission | Why It’s Needed |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| **Full access to your Sheets** (`spreadsheets`) | Read, write, and modify all Google Sheets, including creating, updating, and sharing them. |
| **Read-only sheets** (`spreadsheets.readonly`) | Allows viewing spreadsheets without making changes. |
| **Created/opened sheets only** (`drive.file`) | Access only to spreadsheets you’ve created through the app or explicitly selected. |
| **Read-only Drive access** (`drive.readonly`) | Lets the app read your sheets from Google Drive, but not change them. |
| **Currently open sheet only** (`spreadsheets.currentonly`) | Restrict access to the current spreadsheet in use. |

You can choose whether to grant full or limited access depending on the actions you wish to perform in {{CUSTOMER_APP_NAME}}.

## Test Your Connection

After connecting:

- Try importing a Google Sheet or accessing Sheets from within {{CUSTOMER_APP_NAME}}.
- If you see your files or can create new ones, the connection is working correctly.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Pop-up blocked**: Make sure your browser allows pop-ups.
- **Wrong Google account**: Log out of other Google accounts or use a private/incognito window to select the right one.
- **Missing Sheets**: The app can see only those files for which it has permissions. If files are missing, check which option you picked during connection.
- **Consent screen denied**: Double-check that all requested permissions are granted. If access is denied in error, try reconnecting.
- **Error connecting or syncing**: Disconnect and reconnect the integration. If the problem continues, contact {{CUSTOMER_APP_NAME}} support.
