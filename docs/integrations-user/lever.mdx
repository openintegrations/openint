# Connect Lever to Your App

You can securely connect your Lever account to {{APP_NAME}} to sync your recruiting and candidate data. This guide will walk you through the connection process, describe the permissions needed, and help you troubleshoot common issues.

## How to Connect Lever

1. **Start the connection:** In {{APP_NAME}}, go to the Integrations section and find Lever. Click **Connect**.
2. **Authorize Lever:**
    - You'll be redirected to Lever's secure authorization page.
    - Log into your Lever account, if prompted.
3. **Review requested permissions:**
    - You'll see a list of permissions the app is requesting (details below).
    - Click **Allow** to grant access.
4. **Complete setup:** You'll be redirected back to {{APP_NAME}}. The connection is now active.

## Permissions Requested

When you connect, {{APP_NAME}} will ask for certain permissions in order to read or manage your Lever data. The exact permissions requested may vary, but could include:

| Permission | What it means |
|------------|---------------|
| **read** | Read-only access to all data in Lever: candidates, postings, opportunities, etc. (no changes can be made). |
| **write** | Full read and write access: create, update, and delete data in Lever including candidates and postings. |
| **admin** | Administrative access: full data access plus ability to adjust Lever account settings and configurations. |
| **offline_access** | Lets {{APP_NAME}} stay connected without you signing in every time (no extra access to your data). |
| **read:applications** | View-only access to job applications and related data (no changes, and no access to unrelated info). |
| **read:candidates** | View-only access to candidate profiles (no editing or other data access). |
| **write:candidates** | Create or update candidate information (read and write for candidate profiles only). |

*You will be shown the specific permissions requested during setup. Only grant what you're comfortable with.*

## Confirming Your Integration

After connecting, you can:
- View Lever data (like candidates or job applications) directly in {{APP_NAME}}.
- Start automated syncs, depending on your app’s features.

If you don’t see your Lever data or encounter errors, see troubleshooting below.

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

- **Login issues:** Make sure you are using the correct Lever account and have sufficient permissions in Lever.
- **Permission denied:** If access is refused, ensure you approve all permissions requested during the connection step.
- **Authorization expired:** If the connection stops working, try reconnecting Lever from the Integrations page.
- **Changes not appearing:** Sync may take a few minutes. If problems persist, try disconnecting and reconnecting Lever.
