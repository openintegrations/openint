## What Permissions Are Requested and Why?

- **emails:read** – Read your sales email templates and sent email content. *For email tracking and template suggestions.*
- **people:read** – Read your contacts and lead information. *So you can work with all your sales contacts in [Customer].*
- **cadences:read** – View your cadence workflows/sequences. *Allows you to see and analyze your outreach workflows.*
- **activities:write** – Add and update sales activities like calls, emails, meetings. *So [Customer] can log and sync your new activities back to Salesloft.*
- **people:write** – Full access to create, update, delete contacts/leads. *Needed to keep contact information synchronized as you manage records in [Customer].*
- **admin** – Full administrative access. *Usually only requested if you are an admin and wish to connect accounts at organizational level.*

## How to Confirm Your Connection

After setup, you can confirm everything is working by:

- Checking that your Salesloft contacts, activities, or emails appear in [Customer]'s app.
- Creating a new activity in [Customer] and verifying it appears in Salesloft.
- Reviewing the integration settings page for a status indicator or last sync timestamp.

<Tip>
It may take a few moments for data to sync after initial connection. Refresh the page if you don’t see your Salesloft data right away.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

<Warning>
If you see "Access Denied" or "Not Authorized":
</Warning>
