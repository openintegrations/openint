# Connect your Instagram account

Connect your Instagram account to unlock seamless posting, media management, and analytics directly in your app. Once connected, you can manage your Instagram media and insights without leaving your dashboard.

## Prerequisites

- You must have an **Instagram Business** or **Creator** account.
- Your account should be linked to a Facebook Page you manage, as Instagram's API requires this for business integrations.
- If you have a personal account, you need to convert it to a Business or Creator account in your Instagram app (Settings > Account > Switch account type).

## How to connect

1. Navigate to your app's **Integrations** or **Connections** page.
2. Find and select the **Instagram** integration.
3. Click **Connect Instagram Account**. You will be redirected to Instagram to log in and authorize access.
4. Log in with your Instagram Business or Creator account (if not already logged in).
5. Review and grant the requested permissions:

   - **user_profile:** Access your basic profile info, including username, profile picture, and account type. Needed to identify your account in the app.
   - **user_media:** Access your Instagram photos and videos, including captions and comments. Required for managing your media in the app.
   - **instagram_basic:** Limited profile info (like username and profile picture). Required for basic app functionality.
   - **pages_show_list:** Access the list of Instagram Pages you manage. Needed if your account is linked to multiple Pages.
   - **instagram_content_publish:** Post photos and videos from this app directly to Instagram.
   - **instagram_manage_comments:** Manage comments on your media through the app.
   - **instagram_manage_insights:** View analytics and insights for your account.
   - **ads_management:** Manage advertising campaigns for your Instagram business account through the app.
6. After accepting, you'll be redirected back to your app, and a confirmation message should indicate that Instagram is connected.

## How to test your connection

- After connecting, check for an in-app confirmation (such as "Connected" status on the Instagram integration).
- Try refreshing your media list or posting content from within your app to verify access.
- If available, view your Instagram insights or analytics to make sure data sync is working.

## Common issues and troubleshooting

**1. "You must be a Business or Creator account" error:**
   - Only Business or Creator accounts can be linked. Personal accounts must be upgraded in Instagram settings.
**2. "Facebook Page not found" or "Page not linked":**
   - Make sure your Instagram account is linked to a Facebook Page you manage in your Instagram and Facebook settings.
**3. Permissions not granted or missed:**
   - Ensure you grant all requested permissions during the connection process. Without them, some features (like posting or managing comments) may not work.
**4. Connection expired or no longer working:**
   - For security, Instagram connections may expire after a period of time or if you change your password. Return to the integrations page and reconnect if needed.
**5. Stuck on login or consent screen:**
   - Try clearing your browser cache or using an incognito/private browser window. Make sure pop-ups and redirects are allowed.

## Data access and privacy

The app will only access your Instagram data necessary for the features you've enabled. Data accessed is limited to the permissions you grant during setup. You can revoke access at any time from your Instagram account settings.
