## How Does OpenInt Work?

OpenInt offers a unified experience for integrations authentication.

It all starts with OpentInt @Connect: a fully featured embeddable integrations portal. It can be shared as a link with your customers or embedded straight into your app.

@Connect communicates directly with OpenInt who then ensures that by the time that you need to perform any operation on an external API you can get a fresh access tokens.
