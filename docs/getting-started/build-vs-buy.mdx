title: Build vs Buy
---

When building integrations for your application you have three options:

1. Build them yourself (DIY)
2. Use a iPaaS platform
3. Leverage OpenInt

Let's explore the key considerations.

## Comparison Table

| Key Considerations       | OpenInt                                                                                                                     | Do it yourself (DIY)                       | Single iPaaS Platform                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Integrations Offered** | Most integrations in the market, plus no-code custom integration support. [See full list](https://openint.dev/integrations) | Build and maintain each integration.       | Limited to platform-supported integrations, often missing apps outside of main vertical of focus. |
| **Time to Market**       | Pre-approved apps enable instant launch. [Watch demo](/getting-started/intro)                                               | Weeks of work per integration.             | Faster than DIY.                                                                                  |
| **Data Sync**            | Reliable data sync with Webhooks, Workflows and Schedules.                                                                  | Complex and error-prone custom sync logic. | Still requires you to build sync on top of the iPaaS but limited by their unified APIs.           |
| **Cost**                 | Most cost-effective with flexible platform mixing.                                                                          | High engineering costs per integration.    | Recurring fees per integration/connection/user.                                                   |
| **Ownership**            | Open Source (ELv2), self-hostable with full credential export.                                                              | Full code ownership.                       | Vendor lock-in with limited code ownership.                                                       |
