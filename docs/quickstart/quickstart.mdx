## What is OpenInt?

OpenInt is building open source infrastructure to enable the frictionless movement 
of B2B data. [Sign up](https://www.openint.dev) to connect any API in minutes.


We're building a future where developers can leave the hard stuff to us (auth, access management, data 
engineering, enrichment, pipelines, normalization/unification, APIs, db admin, 
security) and focus exclusively on de-risking their startups with great user 
experiences & biz model + distribution innovation.
