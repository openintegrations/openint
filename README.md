# OpenInt

OpenInt makes integrations a joy for developers. We give SaaS developers an edge through native product integrations.

## How is OpenInt different?

1. Turnkey: Launch with our pre-approved Apps and no-code embeddable integrations connect experience.
2. Comprehensive: Access hundreds of integrations directly and thousands via aggregators like Plaid, Merge and Finch.
3. Builderâ€™s choice: Open Source and entirely focused on authentication, developer experience and performance.

## Local https development

Some services (e.g. Clerk, certain oauth redirect / webhooks) require HTTPS, which is a challenge for local development.

One could use ngrok, but an alternative is to modify /etc/hosts along with a locally provisioned & trusted https certificate and handle SSL termination

```sh
# Hosts table modification
echo '127.0.0.1       local.openint.dev' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
# Provission certificate
brew install mkcert
mkcert -install # follow the installation instructions of mkcert if any
cd ~/.ssh
mkcert local.openint.dev
# Local ssl terminiation
npm install -g local-ssl-proxy
local-ssl-proxy --source 443 --target 3000 --cert ~/.ssh/local.openint.dev.pem --key ~/.ssh/local.openint.dev-key.pem
```
