# Evefan Worker

Evefan Worker is a Cloudflare Worker designed to handle event fan-out operations efficiently. It leverages various Cloudflare features to ensure high performance, reliability, and scalability.

## High-Level Architecture

The Evefan Worker consists of several key components:

1. Worker Router
2. Durable Objects for Batching and Error Tracking
3. Queues for Failure Handling

### 1. Worker Router

The worker router is the entry point for all incoming requests. It's responsible for:

- Parsing incoming requests
- Routing requests to the appropriate handlers
- Initializing and coordinating with other components

The router is implemented in the `app.fetch` function, which is exported as the main fetch handler in `src/index.ts`.

### 2. Durable Objects

#### Batching (Batcher)

The Batcher Durable Object is used to aggregate events before sending them to destinations. This helps in:

- Reducing the number of API calls to destinations
- Improving overall throughput
- Minimizing the risk of rate limiting

The Batcher is implemented in `src/batcher.ts` and exported in `src/index.ts`.

#### Error Tracking (HealthChecker)

The HealthChecker Durable Object is responsible for:

- Tracking errors in processing events for destinations
- Providing insights into the error rates for each destination

The HealthChecker is implemented in `src/health.ts` and exported in `src/index.ts`.

### 3. Queues for Failure Handling

Queues are used to handle failures when sending events to destinations. The queue system:

- Stores failed events for retry
- Implements a backoff strategy for retries
- Ensures eventual delivery of events

The queue handler is implemented in the `handleQueueEventConsumer` function in `src/queue.ts` and exported in `src/index.ts`.

## Supported Destinations

Evefan Worker supports the following destinations for event fan-out:

1. BigQuery: Google's fully managed, serverless data warehouse
2. Postgres: Open-source relational database management system
3. Mixpanel: Product analytics platform for tracking user interactions

Each destination has its own specific implementation for data insertion and error handling, ensuring optimal performance and reliability.

## Getting Started with Development

To start developing with the Evefan Worker, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your local `config.json`:
   Create a `config.json` file in the root directory. Use the schema from `@evefan/evefan-config` for the configuration structure. This file should include your Cloudflare credentials.

4. Run the development server:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

5. To build the worker:

   ```
   npm run build
   ```

6. To deploy to Cloudflare Workers:

   ```
   npm run deploy
   ```
