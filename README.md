# OpenInt

Open source integrations with a vision

- Modular
  - Auth
  - Unify
  - Sync
- Extensible
- Self hostable

## Usage guide (WIP)

- [Getting started code sample](./docs/samples/getting-started.ts)
- [Full next.js example](https://github.com/openint-dev/examples)

## Deployment checklist

First setup dependencies

- Postgres (recommend Vercel postgres)
- Clerk (will be made optional later)
  - Setup JWT Template -> Supabase
    - Use `pwgen 32 -1 | pbcopy` for jwt secret
  - Enable organizations
  - (Use the development env is enough for private use )
- Nango (should be but not yet optional if oauth connections are not used)
- Inngest (optional if sync is desired)

Then deploy

- Vercel
  - In addition env vars from the previous dependencies, set up
    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` so that it is a nicer url that the unique per deployment URL that comes by default from Vercle
      - For things like magic link generation
  - Disable deployment protection is the simplest way to get Inngest branch environments to work

## Development guide

### Local https development

Some services (e.g. Clerk, certain oauth redirect / webhooks) require HTTPS, which is a challenge for local development.

One could use ngrok, but an alternative is to modify /etc/hosts along with a locally provisioned & trusted https certificate and handle SSL termination

```sh
# Hosts table modification
echo '127.0.0.1       local.openint.dev' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
# Provission certificate
brew install mkcert
mkcert -install # follow the installation instructions of mkcert if any
cd ~/.ssh
mkcert local.openint.dev
# Local ssl terminiation
npm install -g local-ssl-proxy
local-ssl-proxy --source 443 --target 3000 --cert ~/.ssh/local.openint.dev.pem --key ~/.ssh/local.openint.dev-key.pem
```
