## Introduction

Evefan enables developers to privately capture, transform and deliver customer events at any scale.

Evefan is open source and self-hosted on Cloudflare workers. It can be configured either via Evefan Console or using Wrangler. Get started in minutes using the [Evefan Console](https://console.evefan.com).

## Getting Started

By FAR, the simplest way to configure, deploy, and observe Evefan is via [the Console](https://console.evefan.com).

You can review our official docs for our quick start steps: https://docs.evefan.com

We never get access to your data. However, for the inspired, you can always do that yourself using Wrangler using our [alternative configuration guide here](https://github.com/evefancom/evefan/wiki).

## High-Level Architecture

You can read more about the architecture in our [Architecture documentation](/architecture.md).

## Supported Destinations

Evefan currently supports the following destinations for event fan-out:

1. BigQuery: Google's fully managed, serverless data warehouse
2. Postgres: Open-source relational database management system
3. Mixpanel: Product analytics platform for tracking user interactions

Each destination has its own specific implementation for data insertion and error handling, ensuring optimal performance and reliability.

4. Run the development server:

   ```
   npm run dev
