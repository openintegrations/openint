# Contribution guide (WIP)

## Architecture

- We have both turborepo and nx, though neither in depth
  - Turborepo for built in vercel integration
  - nx for their really nice graph visualization `pnpm nx graph`

## Style guide

- Reference [.cursorrules](.cursorrules) for most up to date conventions to follow when working in this repo.
