## Introduction

OpenInt Gateway enables developers to privately capture, transform and deliver customer events at any scale.

## High-Level Architecture

You can read more about the architecture in our [Architecture documentation](/architecture.md).

## Supported Destinations

OpenInt Gateway currently supports the following destinations for event fan-out:
